Scalekit provides a complete authentication solution for your applications. This guide explains how to integrate Scalekit to handle user authentication, session management, and sign-in pages.

Here's a quick overview of what you can do:

- **Multiple authentication methods**: Support passwordless login, enterprise SSO, and social logins
- **Session management**: Control user session duration and security
- **User management**: Create, update, and delete user access
- **Secure logout**: Handle secure user logout across your application

## How it works

To authenticate users, redirect them to Scalekit's authorization endpoint. Scalekit handles identity verification and returns the user's profile to your application.

Here's a sequence diagram of the process:
