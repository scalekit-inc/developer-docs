## Bring your own signup form

For applications that want to control the sign-up experience on the UI, you can use the Scalekit API to power the sign-up form. This allows you to build your own signup forms while leveraging user-management capabilities.

<Steps>
1. ### Collect user information
   Use your custom form to collect the necessary details from the user, such as their name and email address.

2. ### Create the user in Scalekit
   After the user submits your form, make an API call to create the user in Scalekit. You must associate the user with an organization.

   <InstallSDKSection />

   <EnvSection />

    Create the organization first using the Scalekit SDK. This will return an organization object that you'll need to add the user to.

    <CreateOrganizationSection />

    Once you have created the organization, you can add the user to it by creating a user membership. This associates the user with the organization and allows them to access organization-specific resources.

    <CreateUserMembershipSection />

    <Aside type="note">
    Use [external IDs](/fsa/data-modelling/#external-ids) to attach a unique ID you use to identify the user in your system. This helps you link the user to their account in your system.

</Steps>

After the user signs up, they are redirected back to your application, and you can proceed to [create a session](/fsa/guides/implement-signin/#create-a-user-session).
