Scalekit supports a variety of social connections out of the box, such as Google, Microsoft, GitHub, GitLab, LinkedIn, and Salesforce. This section focuses on how to use Google authentication, and the same process can be used for other social connections.

## Before you start

Please make sure you have implemented MCP auth with any of these [examples](/mcp/integrations/fastmcp).

## Configure Google connection

1. To configure the Google connection, open **[Dashboard](https://app.scalekit.com)** -> navigate to the **Authentication** section -> select **Auth Methods** -> select **Social Login**, and click on the **Edit** button against **Google**.

2. You can select **Use Scalekit credentials**, or you can follow the on-screen instructions to bring your own Google credentials.
