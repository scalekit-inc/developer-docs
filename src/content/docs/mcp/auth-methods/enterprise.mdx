Scalekit automatically handles identity verification via any authentication method, including but not limited to social providers like Google and Microsoft. It also supports authentication with your enterprise identity provider, such as Okta, Microsoft Entra AD, or ADFS, via SAML or OIDC.

In this article, we will explain how to configure an Enterprise SSO connection with Okta as an identity provider. You can follow the same steps to configure any other identity provider.

## Before you start

Please make sure you have implemented MCP Auth with any of these [examples](/mcp/integrations/fastmcp).

## Configure Okta for authentication

1. To configure Enterprise SSO, you need to create an organization.<br/>
   Open the **[Scalekit Dashboard](https://app.scalekit.com)** -> **Organizations** -> **Create Organization**.

2. Navigate to the **Single Sign-On** tab and follow the on-screen instructions. Make sure to click **Test Connection**, and then **Enable Connection**.

3. To enforce that users from this organization are authenticated with the identity provider, add the domain under the **Domains** section in the **Overview** tab (e.g., `acmecorp.com`).

You have successfully implemented Enterprise SSO for your MCP server. Try running any of the [example apps](/mcp/integrations/fastmcp) next.

You can generate an Admin Portal link from Scalekit and share it with your IT admin.
