This document explains how to integrate your existing authentication system with Scalekit's drop-in OAuth 2.1 authorization layer. Follow the steps below to enable seamless and secure OAuth2.1 MCP layer for your users.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

When an MCP client initiates an authentication flow, Scalekit redirects to your login endpoint. You then provide user details to Scalekit via a secure backend call, and finally redirect back to Scalekit to complete the process.

### 1. Initiate Authentication

- The MCP client starts the authentication flow by calling `/oauth/authorize` on Scalekit.
- Scalekit redirects the user to your login endpoint, passing two parameters:
  - `login_request_id`: Unique identifier for the login request.
  - `state`: Value to maintain state between requests.

**Example Redirect URL:**

```
https://app.example.com/login?login_request_id=lri_86659065219908156&state=HntJ_ENB6y161i9_P1yzuZVv2SSTfD3aZH-Tej0_Y33_Fk8Z3g
```

### 2. Handle Authentication in Your Application

Once the user lands on your login page:

#### a. Authenticate the User

Take the user through your regular authentication logic (e.g., username/password, SSO, etc.).

#### b. Send User Details to Scalekit

After successful authentication, make a machine-to-machine POST request to Scalekit with the user's details.

**Example cURL Request:**

```bash
curl --location '{{envurl}}/api/v1/connections/{{connection_id}}/auth-requests/{{login_request_id}}/user' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer {{access_token}}' \
  --data-raw '{
    "sub": "1234567890",
    "email": "alice@example.com",
    "given_name": "Alice",
    "family_name": "Doe",
    "email_verified": true,
    "phone_number": "+1234567890",
    "phone_number_verified": false,
    "name": "Alice Doe",
    "preferred_username": "alice.d",
    "picture": "https://example.com/avatar.jpg",
    "gender": "female",
    "locale": "en-US"
  }'
```

:::note

- Replace `{{envurl}}`, `{{connection_id}}`, `{{login_request_id}}`, and `{{access_token}}` with your actual values.
- You will receive a unique `connection_id` to integrate with your auth system

### 3. Redirect Back to Scalekit

- Once you receive a successful response from Scalekit, redirect the user back to Scalekit using the provided `state` value to the below endpoint.

**Example Redirect URL:**

```
{{envurl}}/sso/v1/connections/{{connection_id}}/partner:callback?state={{state_value}}
```

`state_value` should match the `state` parameter you received in Step 1.

## 4. Completion

- After processing the callback from your auth system, Scalekit will handle the remaining steps (showing the consent screen to the user, token exchange, etc.) automatically.

:::tip

- Ensure your backend securely stores and transmits all sensitive data.
- The `login_request_id` and `state` parameters are essential for correlating requests and maintaining security.

## Next Steps

**Download our sample MCP Server:** We have put together a simple MCP server that you can check out and run it locally to test the end to end functionality of a working MCP server complete with authentication and authorization. You can download and execute a sample MCP server implementation from <a href="https://github.com/scalekit-inc/mcp-auth-demos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>.
