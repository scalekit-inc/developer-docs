AI systems are moving beyond chatbots to agents that act in the real world. They handle sensitive data and run complex workflows. As they grow, they need a secure, standard way to connect. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides that standard. It defines how AI applications safely discover and use external tools and data.

```d2
MCP : "MCP Server"
MCP.Scalekit {
  explanation: "OAuth 2.1 server"
}

MCP.Scalekit <> Chat interface
MCP.Scalekit <> Data and file systems
MCP.Scalekit <> Development tools
MCP.Scalekit <> Productivity tools
MCP.Scalekit <> IDEs and code editors
MCP.Scalekit <> Other AI applications
```

MCP incorporates OAuth 2.1 authorization mechanisms at the transport level. This enables MCP clients to make secure requests to restricted MCP servers on behalf of resource owners.

|  Features  |  Benefit  |
|---------|-------------|
| Industry standard | Well-established authorization framework with extensive tooling and ecosystem support |
| Security best practices | Incorporates improvements over OAuth 2.0, removing deprecated flows and enforcing security measures like PKCE |
| Multiple grant types | Supports different use cases: **Authorization code** for human user scenarios and **Client credentials** for machine-to-machine integrations |
| Ecosystem compatibility | Integrates with existing identity providers and authorization servers |
