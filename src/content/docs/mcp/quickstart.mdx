AI systems are moving beyond chatbots to agents that act in the real world. They handle sensitive data and run complex workflows. As they grow, they need a secure, standard way to connect.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides that standard. It defines how AI applications safely discover and use external tools and data.
Think of MCP as USBâ€‘C for AI. One connector for many services. Instead of building a custom integration for every API, you use one interface that works across models, platforms, and data sources.
