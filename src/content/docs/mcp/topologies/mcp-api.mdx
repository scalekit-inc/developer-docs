## Overview

In real-world scenarios, an **MCP Server** often needs to make backend calls - to your **own APIs**, to **another MCP Server**, or to **external APIs** such as CRM, ticketing, or SaaS tools. This page explains three secure ways to perform these downstream integrations, each corresponding to a different trust boundary and authorization pattern.

---

## 1. Using API Keys or Custom Tokens

Your MCP Server can communicate with internal or external backend systems that have their own authorization servers or API key–based access. In this setup, the MCP Server manages its own credentials securely (for example, an environment variable, vault, or secrets manager) and injects them when making downstream calls.

Human/Agent -> MCP Server: Invoke tool
MCP Server -> External API: Call endpoint with API Key / Service Token
External API -> MCP Server: Return data
MCP Server -> Human/Agent: Return formatted response
```

### Example

- The MCP Server stores an API key as `EXTERNAL_API_KEY` in environment variables.
- When a tool (e.g., `get_weather_data`) is called, it attaches:
- The backend API validates the key and responds with data.

<Aside type="tip" title="Best practice">
Always store downstream API credentials securely using a secret manager. Do not expose API keys through MCP tool schemas or client-facing logs.

## 2. Interacting with Another MCP Server autonomously

If you have two MCP Servers that need to communicate - for example, `crm-mcp` calling tools from `tickets-mcp` - you can follow the same authentication pattern described in the [Agent → MCP](/mcp/topologies/agent-mcp/) topology.

The calling MCP Server (in this case, `crm-mcp`) acts as an **autonomous agent**, authenticating with the receiving MCP Server via **OAuth 2.1 Client Credentials Flow**. Once the token is issued by Scalekit, the calling MCP uses it to call tools exposed by the second MCP Server.

To learn more about this topology, check out [this section](/mcp/topologies/mcp-api).

## 3. Cascading the Same Token to Downstream Systems

In some cases, you may want your MCP Server to forward (or “cascade”) the **same access token** it received from the client - for example, when it trusts the Scalekit Authorization Server and the scopes defined within the token.

```d2 pad=36
title: "MCP → API (Cascading the Same Token)" {
  near: top-center
  shape: text
  style.font-size: 18
}

shape: sequence_diagram

MCP Client -> MCP Server: Call tool with Bearer token
MCP Server -> Backend MCP/API: Forward same Bearer token
Backend MCP/API -> MCP Server: Validate token (issuer, scopes, exp)
MCP Server -> MCP Client: Return authorized data
```

### When to Use This Pattern

- Both systems (MCP Server and backend MCP/API) trust **the same Authorization Server** (Scalekit).  
- The backend API can validate JWTs using public keys or JWKS URL.  
- Scopes and issuer claims (`iss`, `scope`, `exp`) are sufficient to determine access.

<Aside type="note" title="Caution">
Only cascade tokens across services that share the same trust boundary. If your backend MCP or API does not validate Scalekit-issued tokens, use a separate service credential or client credentials flow instead.
