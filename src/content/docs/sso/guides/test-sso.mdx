After implementing Single Sign-On using our [Quickstart guide](/sso/quickstart/), you need to validate your integration for all possible scenarios. We have set up your development environment with two key components to make testing comprehensive and straightforward:

1. **Identity Provider Simulator:** Test all possible Single Sign-On scenarios without requiring external services like Okta or Microsoft Entra ID.
2. **Test organization:** Access a pre-configured organization with an SSO connection to our IdP Simulator and domains like `@example.com` or `@example.org` for testing.

To ensure a successful SSO implementation, test all three scenarios described in this guide before deploying to production.

## Service provider (SP) initiated SSO <Badge text="Scenario 1" variant="note" />

In this common scenario, users start the Single Sign-On process from your application's login page.

**How SP-initiated SSO works**

### Generating an authorization URL

Use the following code to generate an authorization URL with your organization ID (as shown in step 2 of the sequence diagram). See the [Authorization URL documentation](/sso/guides/authorization-url/) for more details.

<Tabs syncKey="tech-stack">
<TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```js wrap
const options = {};
options['organizationId'] = 'org_32656XXXXXX0438';

// Generate Authorization Url
const authorizationURL = scalekit.getAuthorizationUrl(redirectUrl, options);

res.redirect(authorizationUrl);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```py
options = {"organizationId": 'org_32656XXXXXX0438'}

# Generate Authorization URL
authorization_url = scalekit.get_authorization_url(
    redirect_url,
    options,
)

redirect(authorization_url)
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="go" label="Go">

```go
options.organizationId = "org_32656XXXXXX0438"

// Generate Authorization URL
authorizationURL := scalekitClient.GetAuthorizationUrl(
  redirectUrl,
  options,
)

// Redirect the user to the Authorization URL
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
options.setOrganizationId("org_32656XXXXXX0438");

// Generate Authorization Url
String url = scalekitClient
        .authentication()
        .getAuthorizationUrl(redirectUrl, options)
        .toString();

// Redirect the user to the Authorization URL
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Testing with the IdP Simulator

1. The user will be redirected to the Identity Provider (IdP) Simulator
2. Select "User login via SSO" to view the simulation form
3. Enter user details to simulate a user signing in via SSO

<figure>
  ![IdP Simulator](@/assets/docs/manual/fundamentals/testing-sso/with-idp-simulator/2.1.png)
</figure>

After entering the user details, your application will receive an `idToken` indicating successful simulation. The token contains the following details:

</figure>

<Aside>
**Note:** To receive custom attributes from the IdP Simulator, first register them in Scalekit Workspace at Development > Single Sign-On > Custom Attributes.
</Aside>

## Identity Provider (IdP) initiated SSO <Badge text="Scenario 2" variant="note" />

In this scenario, users start the sign-in process from the Identity Provider, typically through an applications catalog. This allows users to conveniently access applications available within their organization.

If you haven't implemented IdP-initiated SSO in your application yet, follow our [guide for implementing IdP-initiated SSO](/sso/guides/idp-init-sso) before testing this scenario.

![How IdP-initiated SSO works](@/assets/docs/manual/fundamentals/testing-sso/with-idp-simulator/4.png)

### Testing IdP-initiated SSO

1. Generate the authorization URL using the Test organization
2. Get redirected to the IdP Simulator
3. Select "IdP initiated SSO" from the dropdown menu
4. Enter test user details to simulate the login

![IdP initiated SSO](@/assets/docs/manual/fundamentals/testing-sso/with-idp-simulator/3.1.png)

### Testing IdP-initiated requests

Implement logic in your callback handler to identify and process IdP-initiated requests from Scalekit. Learn more about [implementing IdP-initiated SSO](/sso/guides/idp-init-sso).

![IdP initiated SSO](@/assets/docs/manual/fundamentals/testing-sso/with-idp-simulator/3.2.png)

For IdP-initiated callbacks, retrieve necessary details (such as `connection_id` or `organization_id`) from Scalekit to construct an authorization URL. This effectively converts an IdP-initiated SSO into an SP-initiated SSO.

<Aside type="tip" >
- For simulation purposes, select and simulate IdP-initiated SSO in the IdP simulator. In real scenarios, users would choose your app from their Identity Provider.
- The IdP simulator uses the default redirect URL as the callback URL. Ensure the correct default redirect URL is configured in your Scalekit dashboard.
</Aside>

## Error handling <Badge text="Scenario 3" variant="note" />

Your application should gracefully handle error scenarios to provide a good user experience.

To test error handling:

  ![Error scenario](@/assets/docs/manual/fundamentals/testing-sso/with-idp-simulator/5.png)

<Steps>
1. Redirect to the authorization URL
2. Select the "Error" scenario in the IdP simulator
3. Process the error in your callback handler
</Steps>
