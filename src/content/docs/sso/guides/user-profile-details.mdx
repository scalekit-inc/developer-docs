When a user logs in with SSO, each identity provider shares the user profile information in their own format. This adds
complexity for the application developers to parse the user profile info and code related identity workflows. To make
this seamless for developers, Scalekit normalizes the user profile info into a standard set of fields across all
identity providers.

This means that you'd always receive the user profile payload in a fixed set of fields, irrespective of the identity
provider and protocol you interact with. This is one of our foundational aspects of the unified SSO solution.

## Full list of user profile attributes

| Profile attribute | Data type | Description |
|------------------|-----------|-------------|
| `sub` | string | An identifier for the user, as submitted by the identity provider that completed the single sign-on. |
| `email` | string | The user's email address. |
| `email_verified` | boolean | True if the user's e-mail address has been verified as claimed by the identity provider; otherwise false. |
| `name` | string | Fully formatted user's name |
| `family_name` | string | The user's surname or last name. |
| `given_name` | string | The user's given name or first name. |
| `locale` | string | The user's locale, represented by a BCP 47 language tag. Example: 'en' |
| `picture` | string | The user's profile picture in URL format |
| `identities` | Array of [Identity objects](/sso/guides/user-profile-details/#identity-object-attributes) | Array of all identity information received from the identity providers in the raw format |

### Identity object attributes

| Identity attribute | Data type | Description |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------|
| `organization_id` | string | Unique ID of the organization to which this user belongs to |
| `connection_id` | string | Unique ID of the connection for which this identity data is fetched from |
| `connection_type` | string | type of the connection: SAML or OIDC |
| `provider_name` | string | name of the connection provider. Example: Okta, Google, Auth0 |
| `social` | boolean | Is the connection a social provider (like Google, Microsoft, GitHub etc) or an enterprise connection. |
| `provider_raw_attributes` | object | key-value map of all the raw attributes received from the connection provider as-is |

<Aside type="note">

- The `sub` field is a concatenation of the `connection_id` and a unique identifier assigned to the user by the identity provider.
- The identities array may contain multiple objects if the user has authenticated through different methods.
- The `provider_raw_attributes` object contains all original data from the identity provider, which may vary based on the provider and connection type.
