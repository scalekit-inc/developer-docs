Reference of error codes and how to handle them

When users attempt to log in via single sign-on (SSO) using Scalekit, any issues encountered will result in error details being sent to your application's redirect URI via the `error` and `error_description` query parameters. Proper error handling ensures a better user experience.

## Integration related errors

If there is any issue between Scalekit and your application, the following errors may occur:

:::tip
Ideally, you would want to catch these errors in the development environments. These errors are not meant to be exposed to your customers in the production environments.
:::

| Error | Error description | Possible resolution strategy |
|-------|------------------|----------------------------|
| <pre>invalid_redirect_uri</pre> | Redirect URI is not part of the pre-approved list of redirect URIs | Add the valid URL in the Scalekit dashboard before using it |
| <pre>invalid_connection_selector</pre> | Missing `organization_id` (or) `connection_id` (or) `domain` (or) `provider` in the authorization URL | Include at least one of these parameters in the request |
| <pre>no_active_connections</pre> | There are no active SSO connections configured to process the single sign-on request | Ensure active SSO connections are set up |
| <pre>connection_not_active</pre> | The configured connection is not active | Enable the SSO connection in the Scalekit dashboard |
| <pre>no_configured_connections</pre> | No active SSO connections configured | Ensure active SSO connections are set up |
| <pre>invalid_organization_id</pre> | Invalid organization ID | Verify and use a valid organization ID |
| <pre>invalid_connection_id</pre> | Invalid connection ID | Verify and use a valid connection ID |
| <pre>domain_not_found</pre> | No domain specified for the SSO connection(s) | Check domain configuration in Scalekit dashboard |
| <pre>invalid_user_domain</pre> | User's domain not allowed for this SSO connection | Ensure user domain is part of the allowed domains list |
| <pre>server_error</pre> | _actual error description from the server_ | This must be a rare occurrence. Please reach out to us via your private slack channel or <a href="mailto:support@scalekit.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via email</a> |

## SSO configuration related errors

If SSO configuration issues arise, you will encounter the following errors:

:::tip
Ideally, these errors should have been caught and handled by your customer's IT admin at the time of SSO configuration. If your customers encounter problems with the single sign-on (SSO) setup, they will have the opportunity to review and correct the configuration during the "Test connection" step.

Once your customer configures the SSO settings properly, tests the configuration and enables it - you shouldn't receive these errors unless something has been modified, tampered or changed with identity provider.

| Error code | Error description | Possible resolution strategy |
|------------|------------------|----------------------------|
| <pre>mandatory_attribute_missing</pre> | Missing mandatory user attributes | Ensure all the mandatory user attributes are configured properly |
| <pre>invalid_id_token</pre> | Invalid ID token | Check the identity provider's functioning |
| <pre>failed_to_exchange_token</pre> | Token exchange failure due to incorrect `client_secret` | Update the `client_secret` with the correct value |
| <pre>user_info_retrieve_failed</pre> | User info retrieval failed, possibly due to an incorrect `client_secret` or other issues | Update the `client_secret` with the correct value. If unsuccessful, investigate further. Please reach out to us via your private slack channel or <a href="mailto:support@scalekit.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via email</a> |
| <pre>invalid_saml_metadata</pre> | Incorrect SAML metadata configuration | Update SAML metadata URL with the correct value |

| <pre>invalid_acs_url</pre> | Invalid ACS URL | Review and update the ACS URL in the identity provider's settings |

| <pre>malformed_saml_response</pre> | Marshalling error | Ensure SAML response is properly formatted |
| <pre>assertion_expired</pre> | Expired SAML assertion | We received an expired SAML assertion. This could be because of clock skew between the identity provider's server and our servers.
