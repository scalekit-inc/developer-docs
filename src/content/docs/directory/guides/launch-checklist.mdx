As you prepare to launch SCIM provisioning to production, you should confirm that your configuration satisfies the SCIM-specific items from the authentication launch checklist.

This page extracts the SCIM provisioning items from the main authentication [production readiness checklist](/authenticate/launch-checklist/) and organizes them for your directory rollout.


<CheckItem iconName="approve-check-circle"> **Configure SCIM webhook endpoints** </CheckItem>
Configure webhook endpoints to receive SCIM events in your production environment, and ensure they use HTTPS and correct domain configuration.

<CheckItem iconName="approve-check-circle"> **Verify webhook security with signature validation** </CheckItem>
Implement signature validation for incoming SCIM webhooks so only Scalekit can trigger provisioning changes. See [webhook best practices](/guides/webhooks-best-practices/) for guidance.

<CheckItem iconName="approve-check-circle"> **Test user provisioning, updates, and deprovisioning** </CheckItem>
   Test user provisioning flows (create), deprovisioning flows (deactivate or delete), and user profile updates to ensure your application responds correctly to each event type.

<CheckItem iconName="approve-check-circle"> **Validate group-based role assignment** </CheckItem>

Set up group-based role assignment and synchronization, and verify that group membership changes in the identity provider correctly map to roles and permissions in your application.

<CheckItem iconName="approve-check-circle"> **Handle duplicate and invalid data scenarios** </CheckItem>
Test error scenarios such as duplicate users, conflicting identifiers, and invalid data payloads so your integration fails safely and surfaces actionable errors.

<CheckItem iconName="approve-check-circle"> **Align SCIM with user and organization models** </CheckItem>
Confirm that your SCIM implementation matches your user and organization data model, including how you represent organizations, teams, and role assignments in your system.

<CheckItem iconName="approve-check-circle"> **Finalize admin portal configuration for directory admins** </CheckItem>
Ensure directory admins can configure SCIM connections in the admin portal, and that your branding and access controls are correct for enterprise customers.
