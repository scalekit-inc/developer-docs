A webhook (also called a web callback or HTTP push API) is a way for Scalekit to provide your applications with real-time information. A webhook delivers data to your applications as it happens, meaning you get data immediately, unlike typical APIs where you would need to poll for data very frequently to get it in real-time. Events represent specific actions or changes, while webhooks are the mechanism used to deliver these event notifications to your specified endpoint.

By leveraging webhooks, you can build responsive and dynamic integrations that react immediately to changes in Scalekit System, enabling you to keep your systems in sync and automate user lifecycle management and other related use cases.
