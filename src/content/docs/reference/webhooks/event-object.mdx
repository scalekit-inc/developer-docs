Scalekit sends webhooks to deliver real-time notifications about system changes. Webhook event objects contain standardized metadata fields and event-specific data in the `data` field.

```json title="User created event payload"

  "environment_id": "env_123456789",
  "occurred_at": "2024-08-21T10:20:17.072Z",

  "data": {
    "user_id": "usr_123456789",
    "email": "user@example.com",

  }
}
```
