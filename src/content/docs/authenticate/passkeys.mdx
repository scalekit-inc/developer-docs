## What are Passkeys?

Passkeys are a passwordless authentication method that uses biometric verification (fingerprint, face recognition) or device PINs to authenticate users. They provide a more secure and user-friendly alternative to traditional passwords.

## Benefits of Passkeys

- **Enhanced Security**: No passwords to steal or phish
- **Better User Experience**: Quick authentication with biometrics
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works across devices and platforms
- **Reduced Friction**: No need to remember complex passwords
