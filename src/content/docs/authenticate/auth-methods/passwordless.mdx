After completing the [quickstart guide](/fsa/quickstart/), configure passwordless authentication to let users sign in without passwords. Users verify their identity using email verification codes or magic links.

## Passwordless authentication methods

Scalekit supports three passwordless methods:

| Method | How it works | Best for |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **Verification code** | Users receive a one-time code via email and enter it in your app | Applications requiring explicit verification |
| **Magic link** | Users click a link in their email to authenticate | Quick, frictionless sign-in |
| **Magic link + Verification code** | Users choose either method | Maximum flexibility and user choice |

<Aside type="tip">
Magic link + Verification code gives users the flexibility to choose their preferred authentication method, improving user experience.

## Configure passwordless settings

In the Scalekit dashboard, go to **Authentication > Auth methods > Passwordless**.

### Select authentication method

Choose one of three methods:

- **Verification code** - Users enter a 6-digit code sent to their email
- **Magic link** - Users click a link in their email to authenticate
- **Magic link + Verification code** - Users can choose either method

### Set expiry period

Configure how long verification codes and magic links remain valid:

- **Default**: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- **Range**: 60 to 3600 seconds
- **Recommendation**: 300 seconds balances security and usability

<Aside type="note">
Shorter expiry periods improve security but may frustrate users with slow email delivery. Longer periods increase the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised.
</Aside>


#### Enforce same browser origin

When enforcing same browser origin, users are required to complete magic link authentication within the same browser where they initiated the login process. This security feature is particularly recommended for applications dealing with sensitive data or financial transactions, as it adds an extra layer of protection against potential unauthorized access attempts.

**Example scenario**: A healthcare app where a user requests a magic link on their laptop. If someone intercepts the email and tries to open it on a different device, the authentication fails.

#### Regenerate passwordless credentials on resend

When a user requests a new passwordless credential, the system generates a fresh code or link while automatically invalidating the previous one. This approach is recommended for all applications as a critical security measure to prevent potential misuse of compromised credentials.

**Example scenario**: A user requests a verification code but doesn't receive it. They request a new code. With this setting enabled, the first code becomes invalid, preventing unauthorized access if the original email was intercepted.
