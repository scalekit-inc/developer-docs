After completing the [quickstart guide](/fsa/quickstart/), configure passwordless authentication to let users sign in without passwords. Users verify their identity using email verification codes or magic links.

## Passwordless authentication methods

Scalekit supports three passwordless methods:

| Method | How it works | Best for |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **Verification code** | Users receive a one-time code via email and enter it in your app | Applications requiring explicit verification |
| **Magic link** | Users click a link in their email to authenticate | Quick, frictionless sign-in |
| **Magic link + Verification code** | Users choose either method | Maximum flexibility and user choice |

<Aside type="tip">
Magic link + Verification code gives users the flexibility to choose their preferred authentication method, improving user experience.
</Aside>

## Configure passwordless settings

In the Scalekit dashboard, go to **Authentication > Auth methods > Passwordless**.

### Select authentication method

Choose one of three methods:

- **Verification code** - Users enter a 6-digit code sent to their email
- **Magic link** - Users click a link in their email to authenticate
- **Magic link + Verification code** - Users can choose either method

### Set expiry period

Configure how long verification codes and magic links remain valid:

- **Default**: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- **Range**: 60 to 3600 seconds
- **Recommendation**: 300 seconds balances security and usability

<Aside type="note">
Shorter expiry periods improve security but may frustrate users with slow email delivery. Longer periods increase the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised.
</Aside>


#### Enforce same browser origin

**What it does**: Users must complete magic link authentication in the same browser they started in.

**When to use**: Recommended for applications handling sensitive data or financial transactions.

**Example scenario**: A healthcare app where a user requests a magic link on their laptop. If someone intercepts the email and tries to open it on a different device, the authentication fails.

#### Regenerate passwordless credentials on resend

**What it does**: Each resend generates a new code or link and invalidates the previous one.

**When to use**: Recommended for all applications to prevent reuse of compromised credentials.

**Example scenario**: A user requests a verification code but doesn't receive it. They request a new code. With this setting enabled, the first code becomes invalid, preventing unauthorized access if the original email was intercepted.

## Enable passwordless authentication

1. Navigate to **Authentication > Auth methods > Passwordless** in the dashboard
2. Click **Enable**
3. Select your preferred authentication method
4. Configure the expiry period
5. Enable security options as needed
6. Click **Save**

After enabling passwordless, users see it as an option on your login page alongside other configured authentication methods.
