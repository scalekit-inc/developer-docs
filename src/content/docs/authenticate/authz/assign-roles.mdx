After registering the necessary roles and permissions for your application, Scalekit provides flexible role assignment options. By default, the organization creator receives an `admin` role, while subsequent users joining the organization are assigned a `member` role.

You can assign roles to users through three primary methods:

- **Dashboard Management**: Update user roles directly in the Scalekit dashboard. While convenient for initial setup, this approach can become challenging to scale as your organization grows.


- **Default role configuration**: Customize default roles in the Scalekit dashboard, ensuring that new workspace creators or members automatically receive predefined roles upon joining.

- **SDK-powered role management**: Leverage the Scalekit SDK to build custom role modification features within your application. This approach allows authorized users to manage roles programmatically. For example, in a payroll application, HR administrators could change an employee's role directly through your app's interface.
