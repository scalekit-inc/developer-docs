Applications in Scalekit represent individual apps that participate in authentication and Single Sign-On.  
Each application gets its own OAuth client and configuration, while sharing the same underlying user session.

Use this page to create new applications, manage credentials, and configure redirect URLs using the Scalekit dashboard.

## Navigate to Applications

1. Sign in to **https://app.scalekit.com**
2. From the left sidebar, go to **Developers → Applications**

You will see a list of applications already created for the selected environment. 
<Aside>
Scalekit creates a **default web application** for every environment at creation time to help developers get started quickly. This app is environment-scoped and **cannot be deleted**.
</Aside>



## Create a new application

Click **Create Application** to add a new app. You’ll be asked to provide:
- **Application name** – A human-readable name for identifying the app
- **Application type** – Determines how authentication and credentials work

Available application types:

- **Web Application**: Server-side applications that can securely store secrets.
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: Browser-based applications. Public clients with PKCE enforced.
- **Native Application**: Desktop or mobile apps. Public clients with PKCE enforced.

Once created, Scalekit generates a **Client ID**. Only Web Applications can generate **Client Secrets**.

## Application configuration

Open an application to view and edit its configuration.

### Application details

- **Allow Scalekit Management API access**  
  Enables this application’s credentials to call Scalekit Management APIs. Applicable only to **Web Applications**.

- **Enforce PKCE**  
  Requires PKCE for authorization requests. Always enabled and not editable for **SPA** and **Native** applications.

- **Access token expiry time**: Overrides the environment default access token lifetime for this application.

Note: Access token expiry should always be **shorter than the idle session timeout** to ensure predictable session behavior.

### Client credentials

Each application has a unique **Client ID**. When a new client secret is generated, it is shown **only once**. Make sure to copy and store it securely.

- **Web Applications**
  - Can generate a **Client Secret**
  - A maximum of **two active secrets** is allowed at a time
  - Generating a new secret always creates a **new value**, enabling safe rotation

- **SPA and Native Applications**
  - Do not have client secrets
  - Authenticate using Authorization Code with PKCE only

## Configure redirect URLs

Open the **Redirects** tab for an application to manage redirect endpoints. These URLs act as an allowlist and control where Scalekit can redirect users during authentication flows.

### Redirect URL types

- **Post login URLs**: Allowed values for `redirect_uri` used with `/oauth/authorize`.
- **Initiate login URL**: Where Scalekit redirects users when authentication starts outside your app.
- **Post logout URLs**: Where users are redirected after a successful logout.
- **Back channel logout URL**: A secure endpoint that Scalekit calls to notify your application that a user session has been revoked.

Back channel logout is applicable only to **Web Applications**.

For definitions, validation rules, custom URI schemes, and environment-specific behavior, see [here](/guides/dashboard/redirects/)

## Delete an application

Applications can be deleted from the bottom of the configuration page.

- This action is **permanent and irreversible**.
- Existing refresh tokens associated with the application will no longer be valid.
