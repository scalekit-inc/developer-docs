Before launching your authentication system to production, you need to ensure that every aspect of your implementation is secure, tested, and ready for real users. This comprehensive checklist covers security configuration, authentication flows, user management, monitoring, and compliance requirements.

Use this checklist systematically to verify that your authentication implementation meets production standards. Each section addresses critical aspects of a production-ready authentication system, from security hardening to user experience testing.


## User authentication

Ensure your authentication system is hardened against common security threats and all core flows work correctly.

- [ ] Enable HTTPS for all authentication endpoints (prevents token interception)
- [ ] Test login initiation with authorization URL
- [ ] Validate redirect URLs match your dashboard configuration exactly
- [ ] Test authentication completion and code exchange
- [ ] Validate `state` parameter in callbacks to prevent CSRF attacks
- [ ] Verify session token storage with `httpOnly`, `secure`, and `sameSite` flags as required
- [ ] Test session timeout and automatic token refresh
- [ ] Verify logout functionality clears sessions completely
- [ ] Test error handling for expired tokens, invalid codes, and network failures
- [ ] Test the complete flow end-to-end in a staging environment

## Manage auth methods

Verify all configured authentication methods work correctly from initiation to completion.

- [ ] Test all enabled authentication methods (email/password, magic links, social logins)
- [ ] Verify social login integrations with your configured providers (Google, Microsoft, GitHub, etc.)
- [ ] Test passkey authentication flows (if enabled)
- [ ] Test enterprise SSO connections (if configured)
- [ ] Verify auth method selection UI works correctly
- [ ] Test fallback scenarios when auth methods fail
- [ ] Configure proper CORS settings (restrict allowed origins to your domains)

## Manage users & orgs

Configure how users and organizations are managed in your application.

- [ ] Configure user profile fields you need to collect during sign-up
- [ ] Set up organization management (workspaces, teams, tenants)
- [ ] Test organization creation flow
- [ ] Test adding users to organizations
- [ ] Test removing users from organizations
- [ ] Test user invitation flow and email templates
- [ ] Set allowed email domains for organization sign-ups (if applicable)
- [ ] Verify organization switching works for users in multiple organizations
- [ ] Test user and organization deletion flows
- [ ] Review [user management settings](/authenticate/fsa/user-management-settings) in your dashboard

If you're implementing role-based access control (RBAC), verify these authorization items:

- [ ] Define and create roles and permissions
- [ ] Configure default roles for new users
- [ ] Test role assignment to users
- [ ] Test role assignment to organization members
- [ ] Verify permission checks in application code
- [ ] Test access control for different role levels
- [ ] Validate permission enforcement at API endpoints

## Customize

Ensure your authentication experience matches your brand identity and custom requirements.

- [ ] Brand your login page with your logo, colors, and styling
- [ ] Customize email templates for sign-up, password reset, and invitations
- [ ] Configure custom domain for authentication pages (if applicable)
- [ ] Set up your preferred email provider in **Dashboard > Customization > Emails**
- [ ] Test email deliverability and check spam folders
- [ ] Configure custom user attributes (if needed)
- [ ] Set up auth flow interceptors (if using)
- [ ] Configure webhooks for auth events (if using)
- [ ] Verify webhook security with signature validation
- [ ] Review and rotate API credentials (store in environment variables, never commit to code)

## Network configuration for enterprise features

If you're enabling enterprise SSO or SCIM provisioning for your customers, verify these items.

- [ ] Verify customer firewalls allow Scalekit domains
- [ ] Test authentication from customer's network environment
- [ ] Confirm no proxy servers block Scalekit endpoints

**Domains to whitelist for customer VPNs and firewalls**

If your customers deploy Scalekit behind a corporate firewall or VPN, they need to whitelist these Scalekit domains:

| Domain | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `your-app.scalekit.com` | Your Scalekit environment URL (admin portal and authentication) |
| `cdn.scalekit.com` | Content delivery network for static assets |
| `docs.scalekit.com` | Documentation portal |
| `fonts.googleapis.com` | Font resources |



### SSO flows

- [ ] Test SSO integrations with your target identity providers (Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace)
- [ ] Configure SSO user attribute mapping (email, name, groups)
- [ ] Set up admin portal for enterprise customers to configure their SSO
- [ ] Test both SP-initiated and IdP-initiated SSO flows
- [ ] Verify SSO error handling for misconfigured connections
- [ ] Test SSO with different user scenarios (new users, existing users, deactivated users)
- [ ] Register all organization domains for [JIT provisioning](/authenticate/manage-users-orgs/jit-provisioning/) (enables automatic user creation)
- [ ] Configure consistent user identifiers across all SSO connections (email, userPrincipalName, etc.)
- [ ] Set appropriate default roles for JIT-provisioned users based on your security requirements
- [ ] Enable "Sync user attributes during login" to keep user profiles updated from the identity provider
- [ ] Monitor JIT activity and regularly review automatically provisioned users for security
- [ ] Plan for manual invitations for contractors and external users with non-matching domains

### SCIM provisioning

- [ ] Configure webhook endpoints to receive SCIM events
- [ ] Verify webhook security with signature validation
- [ ] Test user provisioning flow (create users automatically)
- [ ] Test user deprovisioning flow (deactivate/delete users automatically)
- [ ] Test user updates (profile changes, role updates)
- [ ] Set up group-based role assignment and synchronization
- [ ] Test error scenarios (duplicate users, invalid data)

## MCP authentication

If you're implementing MCP authentication for AI agents, verify these items.

- [ ] Test MCP server authentication flow
- [ ] Verify OAuth consent screen for MCP clients
- [ ] Test token exchange for MCP connections
- [ ] Verify custom auth handlers (if using)
- [ ] Test MCP session management
- [ ] Review [MCP troubleshooting](/authenticate/mcp/troubleshooting/) documentation

## Monitoring & observability

Set up monitoring to track authentication activity and troubleshoot issues quickly.

- [ ] Set up authentication logs monitoring in **Dashboard > Auth Logs**
- [ ] Configure alerts for suspicious activity (multiple failed login attempts, unusual locations)
- [ ] Set up webhook event monitoring and logging
- [ ] Create dashboards for key metrics (sign-ups, logins, failures, session durations)
- [ ] Set up error tracking for authentication failures
- [ ] Configure log retention policies
- [ ] Test webhook delivery and retry mechanisms
- [ ] Review [auth logs](/guides/dashboard/auth-logs) documentation
- [ ] Configure [webhook best practices](/guides/webhooks-best-practices) for reliable event handling
