Properly deleting users and organizations is essential for ensuring your application's security and regulatory compliance. Whether a user departs or an entire organization must be removed, it's important to have reliable deletion processes in place.

## Enable delete users feature in your app

Before proceeding with permanent deletion, confirm this is the intended action from the admin user. If you only need to revoke access to organization while preserving the user account, consider [removing](/authenticate/manage-organizations/remove-users-from-organization/) the user from the organization instead.

1. Create a custom user interface that allows users to delete their account. This typically involves implementing a button that triggers a call to the Scalekit API for user deletion.
2. To enhance user experience, we recommend including a confirmation dialog before executing the deletion.

Here's how to implement the deletion API call in your application:

<Tabs syncKey="tech-stack">
  <TabItem value="node" label="Node.js">

```javascript title="Delete user permanently" wrap
// Use case: User account closure, GDPR deletion requests, or cleaning up test accounts
await scalekit.user.deleteUser("usr_123");
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python title="Delete user permanently" wrap
# Use case: User account closure, GDPR deletion requests, or cleaning up test accounts
scalekit_client.users.delete_user(
    user_id="usr_123"
)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="go" label="Go">

```go title="Delete user permanently" wrap
// Use case: User account closure, GDPR deletion requests, or cleaning up test accounts
if err := scalekitClient.User().DeleteUser(ctx, "usr_123"); err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java title="Delete user permanently" wrap
// Use case: User account closure, GDPR deletion requests, or cleaning up test accounts
scalekitClient.users().deleteUser("usr_123");
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This is what happens after deletion:

- Scalekit immediately terminates the user's active session
- If the user belongs to multiple organizations, only the membership with the deleted organization is removed
- If the user has no other organization memberships, their account is permanently deleted
- Maintain any required audit records in your system

<Aside type="caution" title="Important">
Permanent deletion cannot be undone. Ensure you have appropriate backups and audit trails before proceeding.
</Aside>

## Enable delete organizations feature in your app

To implement organization deletion in your application:

1. **Create a delete button** in your admin interface that calls the Scalekit API
2. **Add a confirmation dialog** to prevent accidental organization deletions

Here's how to implement the organization deletion API call:

<Tabs syncKey="tech-stack">
  <TabItem value="node" label="Node.js">

```javascript title="Delete organization permanently" wrap
// Use case: Company closure, account restructuring, or removing test organizations
await scalekit.organization.deleteOrganization(organizationId);
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python title="Delete organization permanently" wrap
# Use case: Company closure, account restructuring, or removing test organizations
scalekit_client.organization.delete_organization(organization_id)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="go" label="Go">

```go title="Delete organization permanently" wrap
// Use case: Company closure, account restructuring, or removing test organizations
err := scalekitClient.Organization.DeleteOrganization(
  ctx,
  organizationId
)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java title="Delete organization permanently" wrap
// Use case: Company closure, account restructuring, or removing test organizations
ScalekitClient scalekitClient = new ScalekitClient(
  "<SCALEKIT_ENVIRONMENT_URL>",
  "<SCALEKIT_CLIENT_ID>",
  "<SCALEKIT_CLIENT_SECRET>"
);

scalekitClient.organizations().deleteById(organizationId);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

What happens after organization deletion

- Scalekit automatically handles session termination for all organization members
- All user memberships within the organization are removed
- **Cascading deletion**: If the organization has multiple users who do not have memberships with other organizations, those user accounts are also permanently deleted
- Users with memberships in other organizations retain their accounts and access to those organizations
- Organization data and settings are permanently removed
- Maintain any required audit records and compliance documentation in your system

<Aside type="tip" title="Recommended: Schedule deletion">
If your organization has data retention policies or compliance requirements, consider scheduling organization deletion for a future date (30-60 days) to allow for proper data backup and user notifications.
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution" title="Critical">
Organization deletion permanently removes all data and cannot be undone. Ensure you have appropriate backups and have notified all affected users before proceeding.
