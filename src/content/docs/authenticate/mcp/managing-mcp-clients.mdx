To maintain security and control over your MCP Server, you need to manage which client applications can access it. Scalekit provides several ways for clients to connect, including automatic registration for modern apps and manual pre-registration for custom or trusted clients.

This guide covers the different types of MCP clients and shows you how to:

- View all registered clients
- See which users have granted consent to a client
- Revoke user access for any client

There are three main categories of MCP Clients that can interact with your MCP Server:

## 1. Automatic registration with DCR

These are MCP Clients that automatically register themselves as OAuth clients. Most modern MCP clients, such as Claude Desktop, OpenAI, VS Code, and Cursor, support Dynamic Client Registration (DCR). They initiate the registration process and start the OAuth Authorization flow with the Scalekit server to obtain an access token without requiring manual configuration.

## 2. Manual client pre-registration

These are MCP Clients that you manually register in the Scalekit Dashboard. This is useful when you want to restrict access to specific, pre-approved clients or when you are building a custom client that requires fixed credentials. You can create OAuth clients that can either act as themselves or on behalf of the user.

### How to pre-register a client

If you need to manually register an MCP Client, you can do so in the Scalekit Dashboard.

<Steps>
1.  Navigate to the **Clients** section of your MCP Server.

2.  Click the **Create Client** button.

    <img src={createClientImg.src} alt="Create Client" width="600px" />

    **Configuration:**

    -   **Client name**: A display name (e.g., "My Custom Client").
    -   **Redirect URI**: The URL where the client will redirect users after authorization.

3.  **Choosing the right OAuth flow:**

    -   **For Client Credentials Flow**: Leave the Redirect URI field empty. Your application will authenticate using only the `client_id` and `client_secret`. This is suitable for server-to-server communication.
    -   **For Authorization Code Grant Flow**: Provide one or more Redirect URIs where users will be redirected after granting consent. This is required for user-facing applications that need to act on behalf of users.

    Once the client is created, you will receive a `client_id` and `client_secret` to configure in your application.

</Steps>

### 2.1 OAuth client credential flow

Use this flow when your MCP Client needs to act on its own behalf rather than on behalf of a specific user. This is ideal for machine-to-machine communication scenarios.

**When to use:**

- Backend services or server-side applications
- Automated scripts or batch processes
- System integrations that don't require user interaction
- Applications that need to access resources without user context

**Characteristics:**

- No user interaction required
- No redirect URI needed
- Client authenticates using `client_id` and `client_secret`
- Access token represents the client itself

### 2.2 OAuth authorization code grant flow

Use this flow when your MCP Client needs to act on behalf of a user. This is the standard OAuth flow that requires user consent.

**When to use:**

- User-facing applications (web, desktop, or mobile)
- Applications that need to access user-specific resources
- Scenarios requiring explicit user consent
- Applications where actions should be attributed to specific users

**Characteristics:**

- Requires user authentication and consent
- Redirect URI is mandatory
- Client receives authorization code, exchanges it for access token
- Access token represents the user's authorization

## 3. Registration via metadata URL (CIMD)

These are MCP Clients that support Client ID Metadata Document (CIMD), an OAuth 2.0 mechanism that allows clients to use a URL as their client identifier. When a CIMD-compatible client initiates the OAuth flow, Scalekit fetches the client's metadata (such as name, redirect URIs, and other registration information) from the provided URL. This provides an alternative registration method without requiring manual pre-registration or Dynamic Client Registration, making it easier for clients to authenticate across different authorization servers.

## Manage registered clients

### View all registered clients

You can view a list of all MCP Clients that have been registered with your MCP Server (both DCR and pre-registered) in the Scalekit Dashboard.

1. Go to your MCP Server in the dashboard.
2. Click on the **Clients** tab.

### View consented users

For each registered MCP Client that uses the OAuth Authorization Code Grant Flow, you can view all users who have granted consent.

1. From the **Clients** list, click on a specific client.
2. Navigate to the **Consents** tab to see the list of users who have authorized this client.

:::note
Clients using the Client Credentials Flow do not have user consents since they act on their own behalf rather than on behalf of users.

### Revoke user access

As an administrator, you can revoke a user's consent for a specific MCP Client at any time. This is useful when:

- A user requests to revoke access
- You need to remove access for security reasons
- An employee leaves the organization
- You want to force re-authentication

**To revoke access:**

1. Navigate to the specific MCP Client from the **Clients** list.
2. Go to the **Consents** tab.
3. Find the user whose access you want to revoke.
4. Click the **Revoke** or **Delete** action for that user.

Once revoked, the user will need to go through the authorization flow again to grant consent if they want to use the MCP Client.
