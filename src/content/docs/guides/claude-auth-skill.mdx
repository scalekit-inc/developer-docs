</Tabs>

## Use Claude Auth Skill

After installation, activate the skill in your Claude conversation to generate authentication code.

<Steps>

1. ## Start a Claude conversation

   Open Claude API or Claude Code and begin a conversation in your project directory.

   <Aside type="tip" title="Framework detection">
     The skill automatically detects your framework from package.json, requirements.txt, or go.mod files. Ensure these files exist in your project directory for accurate framework detection.
   </Aside>

2. ## Activate the skill

   In your Claude conversation, request authentication implementation using natural language.

   **Example prompts:**

   - "I need to implement full-stack authentication with Scalekit for my Express.js application"
   - "Add enterprise SSO to my existing Next.js app using Scalekit"
   - "Help me secure my MCP server with OAuth 2.1 using Scalekit"

   The skill will activate automatically when you mention authentication implementation.

3. ## Choose your implementation path

   Claude will ask which authentication path you need. Select one of three options:

   <CardGrid>
     <Card title="Full-Stack Authentication" icon="star">
       Complete authentication system for new applications. Includes sign-up, login, session management, social login, and enterprise SSO.

       **Best for:** New applications or complete auth system replacements
     </Card>

     <Card title="Modular SSO" icon="puzzle">
       Adds SAML/OIDC enterprise SSO to existing authentication systems without migration. Keeps your current user database and login logic.

       **Best for:** B2B SaaS adding enterprise features to existing auth
     </Card>

     <Card title="MCP Server Authentication" icon="rocket">
       Implements OAuth 2.1 for securing Model Context Protocol servers with scope-based permissions and token validation.

       **Best for:** MCP servers requiring user authentication
     </Card>
   </CardGrid>

4. ## Review generated code

   Claude will generate complete, framework-specific code including:

   - All necessary imports and dependencies
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Route handlers with security defaults
   - Session management logic
   - Error handling
   - Production deployment checklist

   The generated code includes security features by default:

   - HttpOnly cookies for token storage (prevents XSS attacks)
   - CSRF protection with sameSite settings
   - Token validation on every request
   - Short token lifetimes

   <Aside type="caution">
     Review the generated code carefully before deployment. While the skill generates production-ready code, you should verify it matches your specific security requirements and business logic.
   </Aside>

5. ## Configure environment variables

   Create a `.env` file in your project root with your Scalekit credentials.

   ```bash title=".env" showLineNumbers=false
   SCALEKIT_ENVIRONMENT_URL=https://your-subdomain.scalekit.dev
   SCALEKIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   SCALEKIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   ```

   Find these values in **Dashboard > Developers > Settings > API Credentials** in your Scalekit dashboard.

   <Aside type="danger">
     Never commit `.env` files to version control. Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental exposure of credentials.
   </Aside>

6. ## Validate your setup

   Use the included validation scripts to verify your configuration before deployment.

   ```bash frame="terminal"
   # Validate environment variables
   python validate_env.py

   # Test connection to Scalekit
   python test_connection.py

   # Test complete authentication flow
   python test_auth_flow.py
   ```

   These scripts verify your environment configuration and confirm successful connection to Scalekit APIs.

</Steps>

   cat ~/.claude/skills/scalekit-auth-skill/skill.json
   ```

   You should see the skill configuration with name, description, and capabilities.

2. ## Test skill activation

   Start a new Claude conversation and type:

   "Help me implement Scalekit authentication"

   Claude should recognize the request and activate the skill automatically. You'll see framework-specific questions about your implementation needs.

3. ## Generate sample code

   Request code generation for your framework and verify the output includes:

   - Complete imports and dependencies
   - Framework-specific route handlers
   - Environment variable references
   - Security implementations (HttpOnly cookies, CSRF protection)
   - Error handling patterns

   The generated code should be ready to use with minimal modifications.

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

### Skill not activating

**Symptom:** Claude doesn't recognize authentication implementation requests

**Resolution:** Ensure the skill is installed correctly by checking the skills directory. Reinstall using the installation script if needed. Verify you're using Claude API or Claude Code (not Claude.ai web interface).

### Framework not detected

**Symptom:** Claude asks which framework you're using instead of auto-detecting

**Resolution:** Ensure your project has framework-specific files:
- Node.js: `package.json` with dependencies
- Python: `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`
- Go: `go.mod` file

### Generated code has errors

**Symptom:** TypeScript compilation errors or runtime errors in generated code

**Resolution:** Verify you have the correct framework version. The skill generates code for current LTS versions. Check that all required dependencies are installed. Review the production checklist included in the generated code.

### Environment validation fails

**Symptom:** `validate_env.py` reports missing or invalid credentials

**Resolution:** Verify your `.env` file contains all required variables: `SCALEKIT_ENVIRONMENT_URL`, `SCALEKIT_CLIENT_ID`, and `SCALEKIT_CLIENT_SECRET`. Confirm these values match your Scalekit dashboard configuration exactly.
