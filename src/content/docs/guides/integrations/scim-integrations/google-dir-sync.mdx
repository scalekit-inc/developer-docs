This guide helps administrators sync their Google Workspace directory with an application they want to onboard to their organization. Integrating your application with Google Workspace automates user management tasks and ensures access rights stay up-to-date.

<Steps>
1. ## Access the directory configuration screen

   Navigate to the Admin Portal of your application and select the "Directory Sync" tab. You'll see a list of available directory providers.

4. ## Authorize Google Workspace

   To establish the connection, you need to authorize access to your Google Workspace directory. Click on "Authorize Google Workspace".

5. ## Sign in with Google admin account

   You'll be redirected to Google's authentication page. Sign in with your Google Workspace administrator account. If you're already signed in with multiple accounts, select "Use another account" to ensure you're using your administrator account.

7. ## Grant required permissions

   When prompted, review and confirm the permissions requested by the application. These permissions allow the application to read user and group information from your Google Workspace directory.

   Click "Continue" to grant the necessary permissions.

8. ## Select groups to sync

   After authorization, you'll see the groups available in your Google Workspace directory. Select the groups you want to synchronize with your application.

9. ## Map IdP groups to application roles

   Map IdP groups to application roles to control access to your application. This needs to be enabled by the host application.

10. ## Enable directory sync

    After selecting your groups, click "Enable Sync" to activate the integration.

</Steps>

<Aside type="note">
If you encounter issues during synchronization:
1. **Authorization errors**: Ensure you have sufficient privileges to authorize us to access your users and groups information from your Google Workspace directory.
2. **Missing users/groups**: We automatically fetch latest users and groups from Google Workspace directory once every hour. If you would like to trigger a sync manually, use the "Sync Now" button in the Actions menu.
