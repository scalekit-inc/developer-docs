This guide is designed to help administrators seamlessly sync their Okta Directory with an application they want to onboard to their organization. By integrating your application with Okta, you can automate user management tasks and ensure that access rights are consistently up-to-date.

This registration sets up the following:

1. **Endpoint**: This is the URL where Okta will send requests to the app you are onboarding. It acts as a communication point between Okta and your application.
2. **Bearer Token**: This token is used by Okta to authenticate its requests to the endpoint. It ensures that the requests are secure and authorized.

By setting up these components, you enable seamless synchronization between your application and the Okta directory.

<Steps>
1. ### Create an endpoint and API token

   Open the Admin Portal from the app being onboarded and select the "Directory Sync" tab. A list of Directory Providers will be displayed. Choose "Okta" as your Directory Provider. If the Admin Portal is not accessible from the app, request instructions from the app owner.

   After selecting "Okta," click "Configure." This action will generate an Endpoint URL and Bearer token for your organization, allowing the app to listen to events and maintain synchronization with your organization.

2. ### Add a new application in Okta

   Log in to the Okta admin dashboard and navigate to "Applications" in the main menu.

   If you haven't previously created a SCIM application in Okta, select "Browse App Catalog." Otherwise, choose it from your existing list of applications. In the Okta Application dashboard, search for "SCIM 2.0 Test App (OAuth Bearer Token)" and select the corresponding result.

   Click "Add Integration" on the subsequent page.

   Provide a descriptive name for the app, then proceed by clicking "Next."

   ![Naming the app 'Hero SaaS' during SCIM 2.0 Test App integration in Okta.](@/assets/docs/guides/scim-integrations/okta-scim/3.png)

   The default configuration is typically sufficient for most applications. However, if your directory requires additional settings, such as Attribute Statements, configure these on the Sign-On Options page. Complete the application creation process by clicking "Done."

3. ### Enable sending and receiving events in provisioning settings

   In your application's Enterprise Okta admin panel, navigate to the "Provisioning" tab and select "Configure API Integration."

   ![Enabling API Integration in Okta for app being onboarded.](@/assets/docs/guides/scim-integrations/okta-scim/4.png)

   Copy the Endpoint URL and Bearer Token from your Admin Portal and paste them into the *SCIM 2.0 Base URL* field and *OAuth Bearer Token* field, respectively. Verify the configuration by clicking "Test API Credentials," then save the settings.

   Give provisioning permissions to the API integration. This is necessary to allow Okta to send and receive events to the app. Upon successful configuration, the Provisioning tab will display a new set of options. These options will be utilized to complete the provisioning process for your application.

4. ### Configure provisioning options

   In the "To App" navigation section, enable the following options:

   - Create Users
   - Update User Attributes
   - Deactivate Users

   After enabling these options, click "Save" to apply the changes. These settings allow Okta to perform user provisioning actions in your application, including creating new user accounts, updating existing user information, and deactivating user accounts when necessary.

5. ### Assign users and groups

6. ### Push groups and sync group membership

   To push groups and sync group membership:

   1. Navigate to the "Push Groups" tab.
   2. From the "Push Groups" dropdown, select "Find groups by name."
   3. Search for and select the group you want to push.
   4. Ensure the "Push Immediately" box is checked.

   <Aside type="note" title="IMPORTANT">
   For accurate group membership synchronization, ensure that the same groups are not configured for push groups and group assignments. If the same groups are configured in both assignments and push groups, manual group pushes may be required for accurate membership reflection.<br />
