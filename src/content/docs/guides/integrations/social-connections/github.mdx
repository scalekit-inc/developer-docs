Scalekit enables apps to easily let users sign in using GitHub as their social connector. This guide walks you through
the process of setting up the connection between Scalekit and GitHub, and using the Scalekit SDK to add "Sign in with
GitHub" to your application.

## Configure OAuth settings

The OAuth Configuration details page helps you set up the connection:

- Note the **Redirect URI** provided for your app. You'll use this URL to register with GitHub.
- **Client ID** and **Client Secret** are generated by GitHub when you register an OAuth App. They enable Scalekit to
  authenticate your app and establish trust with GitHub.
