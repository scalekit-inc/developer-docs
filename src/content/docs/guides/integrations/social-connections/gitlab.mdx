Scalekit enables apps to easily let users sign in using GitLab as their social connector. This guide walks you through the process of setting up the connection between Scalekit and GitLab, and using the Scalekit SDK to add "Sign in with GitLab" to your application.

## Configure OAuth settings

The OAuth Configuration details page helps you set up the connection:

- Note the **Redirect URI** provided for your app. You'll use this URL to register with GitLab.
- **Client ID** and **Client Secret** are generated by GitLab when you register an OAuth App. They enable Scalekit to
  authenticate your app and establish trust with GitLab.
