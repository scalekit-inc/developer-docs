2. Add a new LinkedIn connection
   Click the "+ Add Connection" button and select LinkedIn from the list of available options.

</Steps>

## Configure OAuth settings

The OAuth Configuration details page helps you set up the connection:

- Note the **Redirect URI** provided for your app. You'll use this URL to register with LinkedIn.
- **Client ID** and **Client Secret** are generated by LinkedIn when you register an OAuth App. They enable Scalekit to authenticate your app and establish trust with LinkedIn.

## Set up LinkedIn OAuth 2.0

LinkedIn lets you set up OAuth through the LinkedIn Developer Platform.

2. Copy the generated Client ID and Client Secret into the Scalekit Dashboard
3. Click "Save Changes" in Scalekit for the changes to take effect
