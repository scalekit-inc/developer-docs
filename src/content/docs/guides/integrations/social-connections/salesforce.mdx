Scalekit enables apps to easily let users sign in using Salesforce as their social connector. This guide walks you through the process of setting up the connection between Scalekit and Salesforce, and using the Scalekit SDK to add "Sign in with Salesforce" to your application.

By the end of this guide, you will be able to:

1. Set up an OAuth 2.0 connection between Scalekit and Salesforce
2. Implement "Sign in with Salesforce" in your application using the Scalekit SDK

## Set up Salesforce connection

## Configure OAuth settings

The OAuth Configuration details page helps you set up the connection:

- Note the **Redirect URI** provided for your app. You'll use this URL to register with Salesforce.
- **Client ID** and **Client Secret** are generated by Salesforce when you register an OAuth App. They enable Scalekit
  to authenticate your app and establish trust with Salesforce.

### Set up Salesforce OAuth 2.0

Salesforce lets you set up OAuth through the Microsoft Identity Platform.

<Steps>
1. Use the Redirect URI from Scalekit as the Redirect URI in Salesforce's setup. The URI should follow this format:
   - Development: `https://{your-subdomain}.scalekit.dev`
   - Production: `https://{your-subdomain}.scalekit.com`

2. Copy the generated Client ID and Client Secret into the Scalekit Dashboard

3. Click "Save Changes" in Scalekit for the changes to take effect
</Steps>

## Test the connection

Click the "Test Connection" button in Scalekit. You will be redirected to the Salesforce Consent screen to authorize
access. A summary table will show the information that will be sent to your app.
