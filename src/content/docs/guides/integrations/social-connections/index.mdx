## Benefits of social connections

- **Simplified user experience**: Users can sign in with accounts they already have
- **Reduced friction**: Eliminate the need for users to create and remember new credentials
- **Enhanced security**: Leverage the security measures of established identity providers
- **Rich user profiles**: Access profile information (with user consent) to personalize your application
