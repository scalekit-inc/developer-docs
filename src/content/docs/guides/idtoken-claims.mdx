An ID token is a JSON Web Token (JWT) containing cryptographically signed claims about a user's profile information. Scalekit issues this token after successful authentication. The ID token is a Base64-encoded JSON object with three parts: header, payload, and signature.

Here's an example of the payload. Note this is formatted for readability and the header and signature fields are skipped.

## Verifying the ID token

In some cases, you may need to parse the ID token manually—for example, to access custom claims that are not part of the standard `User` object in the SDK method. These details are encoded in the ID token as JSON Web Token (JWT).

To verify the signature, you need to:

1.  Fetch the public signing keys from the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint.
2.  Use a JWT library for your language to decode and verify the token using the keys.

The JWKS endpoint for your environment is located at:

```sh
https://<YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_URL>/keys
```

For example, if your Scalekit Environment URL is `https://your-environment.scalekit.com`, the keys can be found at `https://your-environment.scalekit.com/keys`.

### Important claims

When validating, pay attention to these claims:

-   **`iss` (Issuer)**: This must match your Scalekit environment URL.
-   **`aud` (Audience)**: This must match your application's client ID.
-   **`exp` (Expiration Time)**: Ensure the token has not expired.
-   **`sub` (Subject)**: This uniquely identifies the user, often combining the `connection_id` and the identity provider's unique user ID.
-   **`amr`**: Contains the `connection_id` used for authentication.

This structure provides a neutral, factual reference for ID token claims in Scalekit, organized according to the data structure itself.

An ID token is a cryptographically signed Base64-encoded JSON object containing name/value pairs about the user's profile information. It is a JWT token. Validate an ID token before using it. Since you communicate directly with Scalekit over HTTPS and use your client secret to exchange the `code` for the ID token, you can be confident that the token comes from Scalekit and is valid.

If you use the Scalekit SDK to exchange the code for the ID token, the SDK automatically decodes the base64url-encoded values, parses the JSON, validates the JWT, and accesses the claims within the ID token.
