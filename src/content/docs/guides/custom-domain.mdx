Custom domains enable you to offer a fully branded experience. By default, Scalekit assigns a unique endpoint URL, but you can replace it via CNAME configuration. This new URL becomes the base path for:

- The Admin Portal where your customers recognize your brand
- Single sign-on and SCIM Provisioning configuration details for setting up connections to identity providers
- The Scalekit REST API endpoints used by your applications

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `https://yourapp.scalekit.com` | `https://auth.yourapp.com` |

<Aside type="note">
- **Integrations:** All existing integrations remain unaffected by the new CNAME URL if they were configured before the change with previous configuration
- **Environment:** CNAME configuration is available only for production environments
- **SSL:** After successful CNAME configuration, an SSL certificate for your custom domain is automatically provisioned

## Set up your custom domain

To set up your custom domain:

<Steps>
1. Go to your domain's DNS registrar
2. Add a new record to your DNS settings and select **CNAME** as the record type
3. Switch to production environment in the Scalekit dashboard
4. Copy the **Name** (your desired subdomain) from the Scalekit dashboard > Settings > Custom domains and paste it into the **Name/Label/Host** field in your DNS registrar
5. Copy the **Value** from the **Scalekit dashboard > Customization > Custom domains** and paste it into the **Destination/Target/Value** field in your DNS registrar
6. Save the record in your DNS registrar
7. In the Scalekit dashboard, click **Verify**
</Steps>

<Aside type="note">
CNAME record changes can take up to 72 hours to propagate, although they typically happen much sooner.
</Aside>

## Troubleshoot CNAME verification

If there are any issues during the CNAME verification step:
- Double-check your DNS configuration to ensure all values are correctly entered
- Once the CNAME changes take effect, Scalekit will automatically provision an SSL certificate for your custom domain. This process can take up to 24 hours

You can click on the **Check** button in the Scalekit dashboard to verify SSL certification status. If SSL provisioning takes longer than 24 hours, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@scalekit.com" target="_blank">support@scalekit.com</a>
