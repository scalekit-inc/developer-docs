Scalekit uses default email templates to send emails to your users based on the scenario. But, we also support you customizing the email templates with your branding and content so that you can customize the email content to your branding and needs.

To customize the email templates, navigate to _Branding > Email Templates_.

On this page, you can customize the email templates by providing the following information:

- **Subject**: The subject line of the email
- **Body**: The body of the email
- **Sender Name**: The name that will be displayed as the sender of the email
- **Sender Email**: The email address that will be used as the sender of the email
- **Reply To Email**: The email address that will be used as the reply to email address

You can also use placeholders in the body of the email to customize the email content for each user. The placeholders are:

- `{{user.name}}`: The name of the user
- `{{user.email}}`: The email address of the user
- `{{auth_request_id}}`: The authentication request ID
- `{{otp}}`: The one-time passcode sent to the user
- `{{magic_link}}`: The magic link sent to the user

Once you have customized your email templates, all the emails that are sent to your users will use your customized emails.
