Scalekit uses default templates to send authentication emails to your users. You can customize these templates with your own branding and content to provide a consistent experience.

Find these templates in **Emails** > **Templates**.

![Email templates list in dashboard](@/assets/docs/custom-email-templates/1-template-listpng.png)

Choose between Scalekit's default templates or your own custom templates.

![Choose template source: Scalekit or custom](@/assets/docs/custom-email-templates/choose-template-src.png)

Select how each email is generated:

- **Use Scalekit template**: Preview subject and bodies; you cannot edit them. Emails use Scalekit's default content.
- **Use custom template**: Edit the subject, HTML body, and plain text body. Your saved content is used for future sends.


## HTML and plain text bodies

Provide both versions of your email body. When both are present, Scalekit sends a multipart/alternative message: HTML is shown in capable clients, and the plain text part is used as a fallback where HTML is not supported.

- Keep content equivalent: communicate the same message in both versions.
- Include full URLs: put the raw link next to buttons in HTML and always include links in the plain text body.
- Avoid image-only content: some clients block images; ensure text conveys the key action.
- Improve deliverability: including a well-formed plain text body can reduce spam filtering and improves accessibility (screen readers, watches).
- Test across clients: preview both bodies in the dashboard and spot-check common clients.

<Aside type="tip">
  If you include tracking pixels or richly styled buttons in HTML, also provide a clear call-to-action link in the plain text body.
</Aside>

Once saved, all subsequent emails will use your customized templates.

## Available template variables

Use these built-in variables in your templates. Values are injected at send time. The variables below apply to the OTP and magic link login template shown here. Other email templates may expose different variables.

#### Application

Use application variables to include app-level data (for example, name, logo, support email) that stays the same across all emails for your app.

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `{{app_name}}` | Your application name |
| `{{app_logo_url}}` | Public URL to your application logo |
| `{{app_support_email}}` | Support email address for your application |
| `{{app_organization_meta_name}}` | Organization display name configured in Scalekit |

#### Contextual

Contextual variables apply only to the current template or send. They change per template or send (for example, OTP, magic link, or expiry).

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `{{link}}` | Authentication link (magic link) |
| `{{otp}}` | One-time passcode for the current request |
| `{{expiry_time_relative}}` | Human-readable time until expiration (for example, "10 minutes") |

#### Organization

Organization variables describe the organization/tenant the user belongs to and are consistent across emails for that organization.

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `{{organization_name}}` | The organization name |

#### User

User variables personalize the email for the recipient (for example, name and email).

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `{{user_name}}` | The recipient's name |
| `{{user_email}}` | The recipient's email address |


## Add template variables at runtime <Badge variant="note" text="Passwordless" />

For more advanced personalization, you can use template variables to include custom dynamic content in your emails.

- Each variable must be a key-value pair.
- Maximum of 30 variables per template.
- All template variables must have corresponding values in the request.
- Avoid using reserved names: `otp`, `expiry_time_relative`, `link`, `expire_time`, `expiry_time`.

<Aside type='caution' title='Passwordless Authentication'>

To substitute these variables at runtime, you must use the Passwordless Headless API to sign users in.

<Steps>
  1. Create your email template with variables:
     ```html title="Example email template" showLineNumbers=false
     <p>Hello {{ first_name }},</p>
     <p>Welcome to {{ company_name }}.</p>
     <p>Find your onboarding kit: {{ onboarding_resources }}</p>
     ```

  2. Include variable values in your authentication request:
     ```js title="Authentication request" showLineNumbers=false
     const sendResponse = await scalekit.passwordless.sendPasswordlessEmail(
       "<john.doe@example.com>",
       {
         templateVariables: {
           first_name: "John",
           company_name: "Acme Corp",
           onboarding_resources: "https://acme.com/onboarding"
         }
       }
     );
     ```

  3. The sent email will include the replaced values:
     ```html title="Example email preview" showLineNumbers=false
     Hello John,
     Welcome to Acme Corp.
     Find your onboarding kit: https://acme.com/onboarding
     ```

     <Aside type="caution">
      The API will return a 400 status code if your template references any variables that aren't provided in the request.
