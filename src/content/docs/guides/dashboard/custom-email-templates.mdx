Scalekit uses default email templates to send authentication emails to your users. You can customize these templates with your own branding and content to provide a consistent experience for your users.

<Aside type="caution">
  Custom email templates are disabled until you connect your own email service provider. All emails sent will use the default Scalekit templates until you configure an external email provider.
</Aside>

## Choose a template source

Select how each email is generated:

- **Using Scalekit template**: Preview the subject and bodies, but you cannot edit them. Emails use Scalekit's default content.
- **Using custom template**: Edit the subject, HTML body, and plain text body. Your saved content is used for future sends.

## Customize your email templates

To customize your email templates:

1. Navigate to _Emails > Templates_ in your Scalekit dashboard
2. Customize the following fields:
   - **Subject**: The subject line of the email
   - **Body**: The body content of the email

Editing fields is available only when you select **Using custom template**.

### HTML and plain text bodies

Provide both versions of your email body. When both are present, Scalekit sends a multipart/alternative message: HTML is shown in capable clients, and the plain text part is used as a fallback where HTML is not supported.

- Keep content equivalent: communicate the same message in both versions.
- Include full URLs: put the raw link next to buttons in HTML and always include links in the plain text body.
- Avoid image-only content: some clients block images; ensure text conveys the key action.
- Improve deliverability: including a well-formed plain text body can reduce spam filtering and helps accessibility (screen readers, watches).
- Test across clients: preview both bodies in the dashboard and spot-check common clients.

<Aside type="tip">
  If you include tracking pixels or richly styled buttons in HTML, also provide a clear call-to-action link in the plain text body.
</Aside>

Once saved, all subsequent emails will use your customized templates.

## Available template variables

Use these built-in variables in your templates. Values are injected at send time.

<Aside type="note">
  The variables below apply to the OTP and magic link login template shown here. Other email templates may expose different variables.
</Aside>

### Application

Use application variables to include app-level data (for example, name, logo, support email) that stays the same across all emails for your app.

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `{{app_name}}` | Your application name |
| `{{app_logo_url}}` | Public URL to your application logo |
| `{{app_support_email}}` | Support email address for your application |
| `{{app_organization_meta_name}}` | Organization display name configured in Scalekit |

### Contextual

Contextual variables apply only to the current template or send. They change per template or send (for example, the OTP, magic link, or expiry).

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `{{link}}` | Authentication link (magic link) |
| `{{otp}}` | One-time passcode for the current request |
| `{{expiry_time_relative}}` | Human-readable time until expiration (for example, "10 minutes") |

### Organization

Organization variables describe the organization/tenant the user belongs to and are consistent across emails for that organization.

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `{{organization_name}}` | The organization name |

### User

User variables personalize the email for the recipient (for example, name and email).

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `{{user_name}}` | The recipient's name |
| `{{user_email}}` | The recipient's email address |




## Add template variables for advanced customization

For more advanced personalization, you can use template variables to include custom dynamic content in your emails.

### Template variable requirements

- Each variable must be a key-value pair
- Maximum of 30 variables per template
- All template variables must have corresponding values in the request
- Avoid using reserved names: `otp`, `expiry_time_relative`, `link`, `expire_time`, `expiry_time`

### Implement template variables in three steps

<Steps>
  1. Create your email template with variables:
     ```html title="Example email template" showLineNumbers=false
     <p>Hello {{ first_name }},</p>
     <p>Welcome to {{ company_name }}.</p>
     <p>Find your onboarding kit: {{ onboarding_resources }}</p>
     ```

  2. Include variable values in your authentication request:
     ```js ins={3-8} showLineNumbers=false
     const sendResponse = await scalekit.passwordless.sendPasswordlessEmail(
       "<john.doe@example.com>",
       {
         templateVariables: {
           first_name: "John",
           company_name: "Acme Corp",
           onboarding_resources: "https://acme.com/onboarding"
         }
       }
     );
     ```

  3. The sent email will include the replaced values:
     ```html title="Example email preview" showLineNumbers=false
     Hello John,
     Welcome to Acme Corp.
     Find your onboarding kit: https://acme.com/onboarding
     ```
</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">
  The API will return a 400 status code if your template references any variables that aren't provided in the request.
