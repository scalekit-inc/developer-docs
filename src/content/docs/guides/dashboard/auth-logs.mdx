Auth logs provide a complete history of all authentication activities in your application. Use them to monitor user access, troubleshoot authentication issues, investigate security incidents, and maintain compliance with audit requirements.

## What you can track

Auth logs help you answer important questions about your authentication system:

- **Who** has successfully logged into your application in the last 24 hours?
- **What** authentication methods have been used by users?
- **When** did specific authentication events occur?
- **How** did your app interact with ScaleKit during authentication?

These records are essential for security audits, compliance requirements, and incident investigation.

## Access auth logs

Navigate to **Dashboard > Auth Logs** to view all authentication events across your environment.

## Authentication statuses

Auth logs display four different statuses that help you understand where users are in the authentication flow:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Initiated** | The user has started the authentication process by hitting the `/oauth/authorize` endpoint. This indicates they've begun the authorization flow but haven't completed it yet. |
| **Pending** | This represents the transitional state between initiation and completion. During this phase, the system performs a series of redirects while exchanging user profile details for authorization code grants, and the authentication is still in progress. |
| **Success** | A successful exchange of the code grant has occurred, and the system has verified the user's identity and granted them access. The authentication flow has completed successfully. |
| **Failure** | The authentication process failed and access was denied. This could be due to invalid credentials, network issues, or other authentication failures. |

## Filter auth logs

When investigating incidents or troubleshooting issues, use filters to narrow down log data and quickly identify authentication problems.

**Available filters:**

- **Time range** - Filter logs by specific date and time periods to focus on recent activity or historical events
- **User email** - Search for authentication events from specific users to track individual user activity
- **Authentication status** - Filter by Initiated, Pending, Success, or Failure to isolate specific authentication outcomes
- **Organization** - View authentication events for specific organizations in multi-tenant applications

Use multiple filters together to narrow down your search. For example, filter by a specific user email and "Failure" status to investigate why a user cannot sign in.

## Common use cases

**Security incident investigation**
Track suspicious authentication attempts by filtering for failed logins from specific users or time periods. Identify unusual access patterns that might indicate compromised credentials.

**Compliance and audit reporting**
Generate reports of all authentication activities for compliance requirements like SOC 2, GDPR, or HIPAA. Export logs for external audit reviews.

**User support troubleshooting**
When users report sign-in issues, search for their authentication events to understand where the authentication flow failed and provide targeted assistance.

**System monitoring**
Monitor authentication success rates and identify degradation in authentication performance. Track authentication method adoption across your user base.
