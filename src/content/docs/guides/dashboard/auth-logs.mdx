Auth logs provide a complete history of all authentication activities performed by users on your application. Use them to monitor user access, troubleshoot issues, and maintain security compliance.

## Authentication event tracking

Auth logs help you answer important questions about your authentication system:

- **Who** has successfully logged into your application in the last 24 hours?
- **What** authentication methods have been used by users?
- **When** did specific authentication events occur?
- **How** did your app interact with ScaleKit during authentication?

These records are essential for security audits, compliance requirements, and incident investigation.

## Authentication statuses

Auth logs display four different statuses that help you understand where users are in the authentication flow:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Initiated** | The user has started the authentication process by hitting the `/oauth/authorize` endpoint. This indicates they've begun the authorization flow but haven't completed it yet. |
| **Pending** | This represents the transitional state between initiation and completion. During this phase, the system performs a series of redirects while exchanging user profile details for authorization code grants, and the authentication is still in progress. |
| **Success** | A successful exchange of the code grant has occurred, and the system has verified the user's identity and granted them access. The authentication flow has completed successfully. |
| **Failure** | The authentication process failed and access was denied. This could be due to invalid credentials, network issues, or other authentication failures. |

## Using filters

When investigating incidents or troubleshooting issues, use filters to narrow down the log data and pinpoint what went wrong.

#### Available filters

- **Time range** - Filter logs by specific date and time periods
- **User email** - Search for authentication events from specific users
- **Authentication status** - Filter by successful, failed, or pending authentication requests
