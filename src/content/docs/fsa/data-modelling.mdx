Now that you have authentication working, you'll want to organize your users into groups and manage access to your application's features. This guide explains how Scalekit's Organizations and Users model helps you structure your authenticated application for B2B use cases.

Scalekit's B2B data model centers on two first-class API entities: Organizations and Users.

- **Organizations** represent your application's tenants or workspaces. They are the core of Scalekit's multi-tenant architecture. Each organization can contain multiple users who work together.

- **Users** are the people who access your application. Each user:
  - Has a unique email address within the Scalekit environment.
  - Can belong to multiple organizations.
  - Is automatically linked across organizations when using the same email address.
  - Can have different roles in each organization they belong to.

This structure lets you manage access across different teams while keeping user identities consistent.

## Planning your organization structure

Your authenticated users will need to be organized into groups that represent your business customers - the companies or teams that use your application. In Scalekit, these groups are called **Organizations**. Each organization owns its data, manages its users, and controls access to your application's features.

Understanding how organizations work will help you decide when and how to create them for your users.

Organizations in your application typically manage:

- **User grouping** - Group users who work together and manage team access to features
- **Data ownership** - Isolate customer data by organization and maintain clear boundaries
- **Billing & subscriptions** - Associate payments with organizations and track usage
- **Security policies** - Define authentication requirements and control access

#### Organization meta label

You can customize this meta label to _team_, _workspace_, or _account_ to match your product's terminology. Navigate to Scalekit Dashboard > Developers > Settings > Application details and update the "Organization" meta name.

For instance, Notion calls these "Notion Workspaces" - collaborative spaces where team members share data, communicate, and work together.

## Linking Scalekit IDs to your own systems

Organizations support custom metadata and external IDs to integrate with your existing infrastructure. This lets you store additional information and link organizations to your billing, CRM, or other systems.

- **Custom metadata** stores additional information like subscription plans, billing details, or feature flags. This metadata is included in JWT tokens, making it available throughout your application without additional API calls.

- **External IDs** let you identify organizations using your own identifiers instead of Scalekit's generated IDs. This maintains consistent identification across your infrastructure and simplifies integration with billing platforms, CRMs, or customer databases.

For implementation details and code examples, see the [External identifiers & metadata](/fsa/guides/organization-identifiers/) guide.



## Organization memberships

Scalekit tracks how users belong to organizations through a `memberships` property on each User object. This property contains an array of membership objects that define the user's relationship to each organization they belong to.

Each membership object includes these key properties:

- `organization_id`: Identifies which organization the user belongs to
- `roles`: Specifies the user's roles (assigned by your application) within that organization
- `status`: Indicates whether the membership is active, pending invite or invite expired

The memberships property enables users to belong to multiple organizations while maintaining clear role and status information for each relationship.

### Migrating from a 1-to-1 model

In a 1-to-1 data model, each user is associated with a single organization. The user's identity is tied to that specific organization, and they cannot belong to multiple organizations with the same identity. This model is common in applications that were not originally built with multi-tenancy in mind, or where each customer's data and user base are kept entirely separate.

For example, many traditional enterprise software applications like **Slack**, **QuickBooks**, or **Adobe Creative Suite** use this model - each customer purchases their own license and has their own separate user accounts that cannot be shared across different customer organizations.

<Aside type="note" title="Need help with migration?">
If your application uses a 1-to-1 model and you're looking to migrate, please [contact us](/support/contact-us) for guidance on the best approach for your use case.
</Aside>

### Migrating from a 1-to-many model

If your application allows a single user to be part of multiple organizations, their profile in Scalekit will also be shared across those organizations. While the user's core profile is consistent, each organization membership stores distinct information like roles, status, and metadata.

If you already have a membership table that links users and organizations, you can add the Scalekit `user_id` to that table. When you update a user's profile, the changes will apply across all their organization memberships.

## User deduplication

Scalekit uses the email address as the unique identifier for a User within an Environment. This means:
- Two different Users cannot have the same email address within the same Environment.
- Scalekit automatically consolidates accounts. If a user logs in with an email and password and later uses Google OAuth with the same email, both authentication methods will be linked to the same User record.

Because of this, you may need to merge duplicate user accounts in your system before migrating to Scalekit. Attempting to create two Users with the same email in the same organization or environment will result in an error.
