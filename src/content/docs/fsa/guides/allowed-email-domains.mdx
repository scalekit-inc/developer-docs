Allowed email domains lets organization admins define trusted domains for their organization. When a user signs in or signs up with a matching email domain, Scalekit suggests the user to join that organization in the **organization switcher** so the user can join the organization with one click. This feature is authentication-method agnostic: regardless of whether a user authenticates via SSO, social login, or passwordless authentication, organization options are suggested based on their email domain.

## Introduction

Allowed email domains can reduce the burden of manual invitation for organization admins, avoid duplicate organization creation, and streamline membership for end users by suggesting the right organization at sign-in/sign-up.

```d2
direction: right


domain_match: "Domain Match?"
suggest_org: "Show option for the user to join organization"
join_create: "User joined the organization"

domain_match -> suggest_org: "Yes"
suggest_org -> join_create: "Join"

```


When a user signs up or signs in, Scalekit can automatically:

1. **Match email domains** - Check if the user's email domain matches configured allowed domains for any organization.
2. **Suggest organization options** - Show the user available organizations they can join through an organization switcher.
3. **Enable user choice** - Allow users to decide which of the suggested organizations they want to join.
4. **Create organization membership** - Automatically add the user to their selected organization.

## Security consideration

- **Disposable and public email domains are blocked** and cannot be added to the allow-list (e.g., `gmail.com`, `outlook.com`). We maintain a blocklist to enforce this.

## Enabling allowed email domains

Allowed email domains can be configured for an organization through the Scalekit Dashboard or programmatically using the API.
