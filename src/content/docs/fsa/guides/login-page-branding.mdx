| Setting | Description | Options |

| **Logo** | Upload your company logo for the sign-in box | Any image file or URL |
| **Favicon** | Set a custom favicon for the browser tab | Any image file or URL |
| **Border Radius** | Adjust the roundness of the login box corners | Small, Medium, Large |
| **Logo Position** | Choose where your logo appears | Inside or outside the login box |

## Background Style configuration

The Background Style setting allows you to fully customize your login page background using CSS shorthand properties. This powerful feature gives you complete control over how your background appears.

### Understanding CSS background shorthand

CSS background shorthand combines multiple background properties into a single declaration. Instead of setting each property separately, you can define them all at once.

```css wrap showLineNumbers=false
background: [background-color] [background-image] [background-position] [background-size] [background-repeat] [background-origin] [background-clip] [background-attachment];
```

| Use case | CSS value | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Background image | `background: url('https://example.com/your-image.jpg') center center/cover no-repeat;` | Sets a background image that covers the entire page |
| Position and repeat | `background: url('https://example.com/pattern.png') top left repeat;` | Creates a tiled pattern with specific positioning |
| Gradient | `background: linear-gradient(135deg, #4568DC, #B06AB3);` | Creates a smooth gradient transition between colors |
| Image with fallback | `background: #f5f5f5 url('https://example.com/image.jpg') center center/cover no-repeat;` | Uses a background color that shows if the image fails to load |

<Aside title="Tips for best results" type="tip">

- Test your background style on different screen sizes to ensure it looks good on all devices
- Use high-quality images that won't pixelate when scaled
- Consider your brand colors and overall design when selecting backgrounds
- For text readability, avoid backgrounds with high contrast patterns where text will appear
