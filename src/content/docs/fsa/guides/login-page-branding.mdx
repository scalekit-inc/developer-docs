Create a consistent and branded authentication experience for your users by customizing the Scalekit-managed login page. You can modify various elements to align the page with your application's look and feel.

From the **Customization** section in your Scalekit dashboard, you can adjust the following settings:

-   **Logo**: Upload your company's logo to be displayed on the sign-in box.
-   **Favicon**: Set a custom favicon for the browser tab.
-   **Border Radius**: Adjust the roundness of the login box corners (e.g., Small, Medium, Large).
-   **Logo Position**: Choose whether your logo appears inside or outside the main login box.
-   **Logo Alignment**: Align your logo to the left, center, or right.
-   **Header Text Alignment**: Align the main header text ("Login to your account") to the left, center, or right.
-   **Social Login Placement**: Control the positioning of social login buttons.
-   **And many more**: Additional customization options are available on-request to fine-tune your login page's appearance.
