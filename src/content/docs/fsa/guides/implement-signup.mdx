Signup is the first step in a user's journey with your application. For B2B applications, each user may be associated with an organization. A user can belong to one or more organizations.

Here are some common signup use cases:

- **New user and organization**: The first user to sign up creates a new organization and becomes its administrator.
- **Joining an existing organization**: An existing user can join another organization or workspace within your application.
- **Invitation-based signup**: A new user signs up by accepting an email invitation and is automatically added to the inviting organization.
- **Automatic organization joining**: A user with a corporate email (e.g., `jane.doe@acme.com`) signs up and is prompted to join the existing "ACME Inc." organization.
- **User provisioning via identity provider**: A user account is created programmatically through an enterprise identity provider (e.g., Okta, Azure AD). The user first logs in via SSO instead of a traditional signup.

Scalekit helps you implement all such signup flows while handling the complexity of user management and authentication.



## Sign up with Scalekit's hosted signup page

You can direct users to Scalekit's managed signup page by adding the `prompt: 'create'` parameter when generating the authorization URL. This is the simplest way to implement a signup flow.

<Steps>
 1. ### Install the Scalekit SDK

    <InstallSDKSection />

    Copy your API credentials from the Scalekit dashboard's API Config section and set them as environment variables.
    ```bash
    SCALEKIT_ENVIRONMENT_URL='<YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_URL>'
    SCALEKIT_CLIENT_ID='<ENVIRONMENT_CLIENT_ID>'
    SCALEKIT_CLIENT_SECRET='<ENVIRONMENT_CLIENT_SECRET>'
    ```

    Create a new Scalekit client instance after initializing the environment variables.
    <EnvSection />
  2. ### Redirect the user to the sign up page
       Generate the authorization URL by passing a [registered](/fsa/reference/redirects) _callback URL_ and _scopes_ to the Scalekit SDK.
       <RedirectAuthPageSection />
     This will redirect the user to Scalekit's managed sign-in page.

3. ### Allow users to sign up
      Users can now sign in or sign up using their [preferred authentication methods](/fsa/guides/auth-methods). Each authentication method is managed by Scalekit to successfully verify the user's identity.

      <LinkCard
        title="Configure authentication methods"
        href="/fsa/guides/auth-methods/"
        description="Enable passwordless, social, or enterprise SSO to customize the signup experience."
      />

4. ## Retrieve user profile after identity verification
      Scalekit triggers a callback to your registered _callback URL_ with an authorization code. Exchange the code to get the user's profile information.
      <RetrieveUserDetailsSection />

      The `authenticateWithCode` method returns an object containing the user's profile information (`user` object) and `idToken` (JWT).
      <UserProfileSection />

      You can [decode the `idToken`](https://authplay.io/pg/token-explorer) to access user information like email, name, and profile verification status directly from the token claims.
</Steps>

After the user signs up, they are redirected back to your application, and you can proceed to [create a session](/fsa/guides/implement-login/#create-a-user-session).
