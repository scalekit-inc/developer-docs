Enterprise SSO allows users to sign in to your application using their organization's identity provider (IdP), such as Okta, Azure AD, or Google Workspace. This provides a secure and seamless authentication experience for your enterprise customers.

![How Scalekit connects your application to enterprise identity providers](@/assets/docs/sso-quickstart/how-scalekit-connects.png)

This guide shows you how to enable enterprise SSO for your customers. Complete the [quickstart](/fsa/quickstart/) first if you have not set up a sign‑in page.

## Onboard your enterprise customer

Create an organization for the customer, then give them access to the admin portal to configure their IdP.

Scalekit provides two ways to give access to the admin portal:

### Share a no-code link

<Steps>
1. Log in to the [Scalekit dashboard](https://app.scalekit.com).
2. Go to the "Organizations" tab and create an organization for the customer.
3. Select the organization and click "Generate link" to create a shareable admin portal link.
4. Share the link with the customer's IT admin via email, Slack, or another channel.
</Steps>

### Embed the admin portal

Embed the admin portal in your app using an `iframe` so customers can configure SSO without leaving your app.

<Steps>
1. Install the SDK for your stack if you haven't already.
2. Generate a one‑time portal link for the organization at runtime.
3. Set the `<iframe>` `src` to the returned `location` URL.
4. Ensure your app's domain is listed as a Redirect URI in the dashboard.
</Steps>

```html title="Render admin portal in iframe (example)" wrap
<iframe
  src="https://random-subdomain.scalekit.dev/magicLink/8930509d-68cf-4e2c-8c6d-94d2b5e2db43"
  width="100%"
  height="600"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="clipboard-write">
</iframe>
```

For a full walkthrough (including how to generate the portal link with the SDK), see [/guides/admin-portal/#embed-the-admin-portal](/guides/admin-portal/#embed-the-admin-portal).

Your customer can use either approach to access the admin portal and set up SSO. After they configure their IdP, the connection becomes active for their organization and appears in your list of enterprise connections.

<Aside type="note" title="Testing SSO integration">
  During development, you don't need to manually configure each identity provider your customers might use. Scalekit provides an IdP simulator that helps you test the SSO flow easily. Learn more about [testing your SSO integration](/sso/guides/test-sso/).

#### Verify organization domains

When organization admins verify domains, users can sign in through their organization's IdP from your sign‑in page. Scalekit uses the email domain (for example, `@megacorp.org`) to redirect them to the correct IdP. This is also called home realm discovery. You can add a verified domain manually from the Scalekit dashboard > Organizations > select an organization > Single sign‑on.

**Organization admins** can verify domains through the [admin portal](/guides/admin-portal/). Once verified, any user with an email address from that domain can use SSO.

1. **DNS verification**: Add a DNS TXT record to prove domain ownership. The Admin Portal guides you through each step of adding the record. Once you add the record correctly, Scalekit automatically completes the verification. <Badge type="note" text="Coming soon" />
2. **Manual verification**: Request domain verification through the Scalekit Dashboard. This method is suitable when you have already verified domain ownership through other means.

For advanced domain-based SSO flows, see [Check SSO domain](/guides/user-auth/check-sso-domain/).
