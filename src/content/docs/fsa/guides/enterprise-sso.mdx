Enterprise SSO allows users to sign in to your application using their organization's identity provider (IdP), such as Okta, Azure AD, or Google Workspace. This provides a secure and seamless authentication experience for your enterprise customers.

![How Scalekit connects your application to enterprise identity providers](@/assets/docs/sso-quickstart/how-scalekit-connects.png)

This guide shows you how to enable enterprise SSO for your customers. You should complete the [quickstart guide](/fsa/quickstart/) before following this guide, as it covers building a sign-in page that combines Scalekit's hosted UI.

## Onboard your enterprise customer

To enable SSO for a customer, you first need to create an Organization for them in Scalekit. Once the organization is created, you can provide them access to the Admin Portal where they can configure their own IdP settings.

Scalekit provides two flexible ways to give your customers access to the Admin Portal:

**Option 1: Shareable Link (No-Code)**
1. Log in to your [Scalekit Dashboard](https://app.scalekit.com).
2. Navigate to the "Organizations" tab and create a new organization for your customer.
3. Select the organization and click "Generate Link" to create a shareable Admin Portal link.
4. Share this link with your customer's IT admin through email, Slack, or other communication channels.

**Option 2: Embedded Portal**

You can also embed the Admin Portal directly within your application using an `iframe`, allowing customers to configure their SSO settings without leaving your app. As a quick start: generate a one‑time portal link for the organization at runtime and set it as the iframe `src`.

```html
<iframe
  src="https://random-subdomain.scalekit.dev/magicLink/8930509d-68cf-4e2c-8c6d-94d2b5e2db43"
  width="100%"
  height="600"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="clipboard-write">
</iframe>
```

For a full walkthrough (including how to generate the portal link with the SDK), see the Embedded Admin Portal section of the guide: [/guides/sso/admin-portal/#embedded-admin-portal](/guides/sso/admin-portal/#embedded-admin-portal).

Your customer can then use either approach to access a self-service portal and set up their SSO connection.

Once they have configured their IdP, the connection will be active for their organization and will appear in your list of enterprise connections.

<Aside type="note" title="Testing SSO Integration">
  During development, you don't need to manually configure each identity provider your customers might use. Scalekit provides an IdP simulator that helps you test the SSO flow easily. Learn more about [testing your SSO integration](/sso/guides/test-sso/).
</Aside>

## Organization domains
Organization domains are used for **Home Realm Discovery**. When a user enters an email address whose domain matches one of the organization’s configured domains, Scalekit automatically redirects them to the correct SSO provider. For example, if an organization registers *megacorp.org*, any user signing in with *@megacorp.org* will be routed to Megacorp’s SSO connection. When the domain matches, Scalekit enforces SSO login for the user. You can manage organization domains in the Scalekit Dashboard or programmatically using the API.

### Manage via Scalekit Dashboard
![](@/assets/docs/enterprise-sso/2025-12-10-14-23-20.png)

<Steps>
1. Navigate to **Organizations** and select the target organization.
2. Go to **Organization Domains** section.
3. Add or remove domains for that organization.
</Steps>

## Manage via API

You can also configure organization domains using the Scalekit API.

## Advanced SSO settings
Scalekit provides additional settings for Enterprise SSO connections. These settings can be managed under **Single Sign On** → **Settings** in the Scalekit dashboard or Admin Portal.

### Just-in-time provisioning
Just-in-time (JIT) provisioning automatically creates users and organization memberships when they sign in through SSO for the first time. JIT is enabled by default for all new SSO connections. Learn more about [JIT provisioning](/fsa/guides/just-in-time-provisioning/).

### Sync user attributes during login
When you enable **Sync user attributes during login**, Scalekit updates the user’s profile using attributes from the identity provider each time they authenticate. This keeps the user’s profile in Scalekit aligned with the external Identity Provider. This ensures that user profile maintained on Scalekit end remains in sync with the SSO identity provider.
