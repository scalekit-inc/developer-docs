Automated user provisioning allows users to be automatically added to organizations when they sign up using non-SSO authentication methods such as social logins (Google, GitHub, Microsoft) or passwordless authentication. Unlike JIT provisioning which works with SSO connections, this feature provides an organization switcher interface where users can join organizations based on their email domain.

## Introduction

Automated user provisioning is particularly useful for applications that support multiple authentication methods and want to provide seamless organization membership for users authenticating through social providers or passwordless methods.

{/* TODO: Add illustration showing automated user provisioning flow */}

When a user signs up or signs in using social logins or passwordless authentication, Scalekit can automatically:

1. **Match email domains** - Check if the user's email domain matches configured allowed domains for an organization
2. **Present organization options** - Show the user available organizations they can join through an organization switcher
3. **Enable user choice** - Allow users to select which organization to join or create a new one
4. **Create organization membership** - Automatically add the user to their selected organization

This process provides flexibility for users who may work across multiple organizations or need to create their own workspace.

## Enabling automated user provisioning

Automated user provisioning must be configured for each organization by setting allowed email domains. You can configure this through the Scalekit Dashboard or programmatically using the API.

### Enable via Dashboard <Badge type="note" text="Coming soon" />

<Steps>

1. Log in to your [Scalekit Dashboard](https://app.scalekit.com).
2. Navigate to **Organizations** and select the organization.
3. Go to **Settings** and find the **Automated Provisioning** section.
4. Configure the allowed email domains for automatic provisioning.

</Steps>

### Enable via API

You can also configure automated user provisioning programmatically using the Scalekit API:

<InstallSDK />

```javascript title="Configure allowed domains"
// Coming soon - API to configure allowed email domains
```

## Supported authentication methods

Automated user provisioning works with the following authentication methods:

- **Social logins** - Google, Microsoft, GitHub, LinkedIn, and other social providers
- **Passwordless authentication** - Magic link and OTP-based authentication

Users authenticate with their preferred method and are then presented with organization options based on their email domain.
