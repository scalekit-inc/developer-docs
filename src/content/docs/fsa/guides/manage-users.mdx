Scalekit automatically creates a user profile and organization when someone signs up for your app. Users can belong to multiple organizations (also called workspaces) with different roles and permissions in each one. Each user needs appropriate access controls based on their organization and role.

## Create, invite, modify, and delete users in the Scalekit dashboard

Manage users through the Scalekit dashboard at **Dashboard** > **Users**. The dashboard provides these user management capabilities:

- Create users directly
- Invite users to join an organization
- Assign roles
- Suspend or deactivate users
- Update user information and role assignments
- View active and inactive users

To add custom fields to user profiles, navigate to **Dashboard** > **User Attributes**. Create new fields to store additional user information. Access these fields programmatically in your application. Map them to identity provider attributes to automatically populate user profiles in Scalekit.

## Prerequisites

<Steps>
1. ### Set up your environment

    <CheckItem iconName="forward-slash">
     [Create a Scalekit account](https://app.scalekit.com/ws/signup) and complete the quickstart
    </CheckItem>
    <CheckItem iconName="forward-slash">
     Have at least one organization created in your environment
    </CheckItem>

2.  ### Install the Scalekit SDK

        <InstallSDK />

        Configure your API credentials:
        ```bash
        SCALEKIT_ENVIRONMENT_URL='<YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_URL>'
        SCALEKIT_CLIENT_ID='<ENVIRONMENT_CLIENT_ID>'
        SCALEKIT_CLIENT_SECRET='<ENVIRONMENT_CLIENT_SECRET>'
        ```

        Initialize the Scalekit client:
        ```javascript
        import { Scalekit } from '@scalekit-sdk/node';

        const scalekit = new Scalekit(
          process.env.SCALEKIT_ENVIRONMENT_URL,
          process.env.SCALEKIT_CLIENT_ID,
          process.env.SCALEKIT_CLIENT_SECRET
        );
        ```

</Steps>

## Create and provision users

Users can be added to organizations through multiple methods depending on your application's workflow and security requirements.

### Create a user directly

When you need to create user accounts programmatically—such as during data migrations, bulk imports, or admin-initiated account creation—you can create users directly with their organization membership.

**Scenario**: An HR system integration that automatically creates accounts for new employees in your customer's organization.

```javascript title="Create a user with organization membership"
const newUser = await scalekit.user.createUserAndMembership('org_123', {
  email: 'john.doe@example.com',
  userProfile: {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
  },
  metadata: {
    department: 'Engineering',
    role: 'Developer',
    employeeId: 'EMP-001',
    startDate: '2024-03-20',
  },
  sendInvitationEmail: false, // Set to true to send welcome email
});

console.log('User created:', newUser.user.id);
console.log('Membership created:', newUser.membership.id);
```

**Key parameters:**

- `sendInvitationEmail`: Controls whether Scalekit sends a welcome email to the new user
- `metadata`: Store custom information relevant to your application
- `userProfile`: Basic profile information like name and other attributes

### User sign-ups

The most common way users join organizations is through self-service sign-up flows. This happens when users discover your application and want to create their own accounts.

**Scenario**: A user visits your pricing page, signs up for a trial, and becomes the first member (and owner) of a new organization.

Scalekit automatically handles this during the authentication flow. When users complete sign-up through your application, Scalekit creates both the user and their organization automatically. See the [implement sign-up guide](/fsa/guides/implement-signup/) for detailed integration steps.

### SCIM-based provisioning <Badge type="note" text="Coming soon" />

Enterprise customers can automatically provision and deprovision users through SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management), keeping your application in sync with their source of truth.

**Scenario**: When an employee joins or leaves your customer's company, their access to your application is automatically granted or revoked through their identity provider.

## Manage organization memberships

Users often need different levels of access within organizations, and their roles may change over time as responsibilities evolve.

### Create membership for existing users

**Scenario**: A consultant who already has an user account in your system needs access to a new client's organization.

```javascript title="Add user to organization" wrap
const membership = await scalekit.user.createMembership('org_123', 'user_456', {
  roles: ['member'],
  metadata: {
    joinDate: new Date().toISOString(),
    team: 'Platform',
  },
  sendInvitationEmail: true,
});

console.log('Membership created:', membership.user?.id);
```

### Update membership

**Scenario**: A user's relationship with an organization changes - they move to a different team/organization/workspace, their contract terms are updated, or their access requirements change.

```javascript title="Update user membership"
const updatedMembership = await scalekit.user.updateMembership('org_123', 'user_456', {
  roles: ['member'],
  metadata: {
    team: 'Backend',
    level: 'Senior',
    contractType: 'Full-time',
    accessExpiry: '2024-12-31',
    manager: 'jane.smith@example.com',
  },
});

console.log('Membership updated with new details');
```

### Remove user from organization

**Scenario**:

- An employee leaves the company or a contractor's engagement ends, requiring removal of their access.
- Organization admin chooses to delete the organization from your application's settings.

```javascript title="Remove user membership"
await scalekit.user.deleteMembership('org_123', 'user_456');
console.log('User removed from organization');
```

<Aside type='note'>
  Removing a membership doesn't delete the user's account entirely—they may still belong to other organizations. Use
  `deleteUser` only when you need to remove the user completely.
</Aside>

## List and query users

Organizations need visibility into their user base for auditing, billing, and management purposes.

### List organization users

**Scenario**: An organization admin wants to see all users in their organization for a security audit or to review access permissions.

```javascript title="List users in organization"
const users = await scalekit.user.listOrganizationUsers('org_123', {
  pageSize: 20,
  pageToken: 'next_page_token', // For pagination
});

console.log(`Found ${users.users.length} users`);
users.users.forEach(user => {
  console.log(`${user.email} - ${user.userProfile.firstName} ${user.userProfile.lastName}`);
});

// Handle pagination
if (users.nextPageToken) {
  // Fetch next page of results
}
```

### List users with filtering

**Scenario**: Find all users in a specific department or with certain roles for targeted communications or policy updates.

```javascript title="List users with pagination"
const users = await scalekit.user.listUsers('org_123', {
  pageSize: 10,
  pageToken: 'next_page_token',
});

// Filter by metadata in your application logic
const engineeringUsers = users.users.filter(user => user.metadata.department === 'Engineering');
```

## User deactivation and deletion

Managing user lifecycle includes handling departures, suspensions, and account cleanup.

### Deactivate users

<Badge type='note' text='Coming soon' />

**Scenario**: Temporarily suspend a user's access while investigating a security incident, or when an employee takes extended leave.

Deactivation will preserve user data while preventing access to the organization. This is useful for temporary suspensions where you may need to reactivate the user later.

### Delete users permanently

**Scenario**: Completely remove a user when they've left the company permanently and you need to comply with data retention policies.

```javascript title="Delete user permanently"
await scalekit.user.deleteUser('org_123', 'user_456');
console.log('User deleted permanently');
```

<Aside type='caution'>
  Permanent deletion removes all user data and cannot be undone. Consider deactivation for reversible user management.
</Aside>

## Metadata and external IDs

Store additional information about users to integrate with your existing systems and business logic.

### Using metadata for custom data

**Scenario**: Track user-specific information like department, employee ID, hire date, or application-specific settings.

```javascript title="Create user with metadata"
const userWithMetadata = await scalekit.user.createUserAndMembership('org_123', {
  email: 'sarah.wilson@example.com',
  userProfile: {
    firstName: 'Sarah',
    lastName: 'Wilson',
  },
  metadata: {
    department: 'Sales',
    employeeId: 'EMP-002',
    territory: 'West Coast',
    quota: 150000,
    manager: 'john.doe@example.com',
  },
});
```

### External IDs for system integration

**Scenario**: Link Scalekit users with records in your CRM, HR system, or other business applications.

```javascript title="Update user with external ID"
const updatedUser = await scalekit.user.updateUser('org_123', 'user_456', {
  externalId: 'SALESFORCE-003921', // Link to Salesforce contact
  metadata: {
    crmAccountId: 'ACC-789',
    hubspotContactId: '12345',
  },
});
```

This integration approach maintains consistent user identity across your system architecture while keeping Scalekit as the source of truth for authentication and authorization.
