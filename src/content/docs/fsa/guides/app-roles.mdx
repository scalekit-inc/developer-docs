Applications often include many capabilities. Not every user should be able to perform every action (for example, only owners should manage billing or payments). Scalekit helps you restrict access cleanly with roles and permissions so users get only the access they need.

Scalekit’s Full Stack Auth (FSA) lets your users sign in to your app. Once integrated, Scalekit acts as access middleware: it verifies identity and shares the user’s role and permissions with your application so you can allow or restrict actions.

## Understand roles and permissions

- **Role**: A convenient bundle of actions. Examples: Admin, Manager, Editor, Viewer. Roles state what a user can and cannot do.
- **Permission**: A single allowed action in your system, typically rendered as `resource:action` (for example, `projects:create`, `tasks:read`). Use permissions when you need fine-grained control.

### Defaults

When a new Scalekit environment is created:
- The first user is assigned the `creator` role.
- Subsequent users default to the `member` role.

These defaults only matter when your application enforces them. You decide what a creator or member can do.

## Model roles for your app

Design roles that reflect how your users work. For a project management app (similar to Linear), you might define:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| Admin | `org:manage`, `billing:manage`, `projects:create`, `projects:write`, `projects:read`, `tasks:create`, `tasks:write`, `tasks:read`, `members:manage` |
| Project owner | `projects:create`, `projects:write`, `projects:read`, `tasks:create`, `tasks:write`, `tasks:read` |
| Editor | `projects:write`, `projects:read`, `tasks:create`, `tasks:write`, `tasks:read` |
| Member | `projects:read`, `tasks:create`, `tasks:read` |
| Viewer | `projects:read`, `tasks:read` |

Keep headers short and permissions focused. Expand this table to match your product.

## Manage roles and permissions

You can register roles and permissions from the Scalekit dashboard:

<Steps>

1. ### Create roles

   - Go to **Authorization → Roles**
   - Click **+ Add role** and provide a Display name, Name (key), and Description. These help your customers understand the role and what they can do.
   - Use a short, machine-friendly key for the Name (for example, `project_owner`)

2. ### Define permissions

   - Go to **User management → Permissions**
   - Create granular permissions like `projects:create`, `tasks:read`, `billing:manage`
   - Map these permissions to the roles you created

3. ### Use inheritance <Badge type="tip" text='Optional'/>

   - Make roles easier to manage by inheriting from other roles
   - Example: let `editor` inherit all permissions from `viewer`, then add `tasks:create` and `projects:write`

   ![](@/assets/docs/app-roles/inheritance.png)

4. ### Set defaults

   - Confirm default role for the environment creator is `creator`
   - Confirm default role for new members is `member`

</Steps>

You can change the default role for both the environment creator and new members at any time in **Authorization → Roles**.

## Token contents and sessions

When your app is integrated with Full Stack Auth and a user signs in, Scalekit issues an access token and a refresh token, and creates a session to track access duration. Roles and permissions are included in token claims so your backend can make authorization decisions.

The `roles` claim contains the role key (not the display name). For example, if the role key is `editor` and the display name is “Content Editor,” the token includes `"editor"`.

While the `roles` claim is an array, Scalekit currently supports a single role per user within an organization.

Here's an example of decoded tokens containing `roles` and `permissions` claims:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="ID Token (decoded)" value="idToken">
<Code
  lang="json"
  title="idToken.json"
  code={`{
  "amr": ["conn_123456789012345678"],
  "aud": ["skc_987654321098765432"],

<TabItem label="Access Token (decoded)" value="accessToken">

  code={`{

  "client_id": "skc_987654321098765432",

  "sub": "usr_987654321098765432",
  "xuid": "john.doe"
}`} />
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

With roles and permissions available in tokens, enforce access in your backend and UI. Example checks:

```js showLineNumbers=false
// Example: check role
const isProjectOwner = token.roles?.includes('project_owner');

// Example: check permission
const canCreateProject = token.permissions?.includes('projects:create');
```
