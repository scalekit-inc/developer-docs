When users sign up for the app, Scalekit automatically creates a new organization. Most applications refer to organizations as workspaces for consistency. The initial user is assigned the `admin` role. All subsequent users who join the same organization are automatically assigned the `member` role.

Information about the organization, user roles, and membership is present in both the access token and ID token received after user sign-up or login. These tokens serve as the source of truth for determining a user's access level at runtime within your app

When your app is integrated with Scalekit and a user signs in, Scalekit issues an ID token and an access token, and creates a session to track access duration.

- **Role**: A role is a collection of actions that defines a user's capabilities in the system. Examples include Admin, Manager, Editor, and Viewer. Assigning a role determines which tasks the user can perform and what access is restricted.
- **Permission**: A permission represents a specific action that a user is authorized to execute, formatted as `resource:action` (such as `projects:create` or `tasks:read`). Assign permissions for precise, fine-grained access control when individual capabilities must be managed.



## Manage roles and permissions in the Scalekit dashboard

Users can be assigned default roles defined by your application. Scalekit also supports custom, organization-specific roles, enabling organization administrators to create roles beyond those your app provides.

Manage app-level roles and permissions from the Scalekit dashboard by navigating to **Dashboard** > **Roles & Permissions**.

- Create roles and permissions
- Choose a **Name**. It's also a Machine-friendly identifier (e.g., project_owner)
- Create roles that inherit permissions from other roles
- Modify permissions assigned to roles
- Choose different default roles for new users

Create organization-specific roles on behalf of organization administrators by going to **Dashboard** > **Organizations** > **Select an organization** > **Roles**.


Roles build on each other, with each higher role inheriting all the permissions of the one below.

viewer: {

}

editor: {

  "(inherits viewer permissions)"
  projects: write
  tasks: create
  tasks: write
}

project_owner: {

  "(inherits editor permissions)"
  projects: create
  members: invite
}

viewer -> editor: inherits
editor -> project_owner: inherits
```


## Manage roles and permissions programmatically <Badge type="tip" text="API" />

Most applications need to manage roles and permissions programmatically to integrate with existing systems. The examples below demonstrate common role and permission management operations.

```js {"1"} title="Work in progress" frame="terminal"

// SDK Methods are a work in progress
```

<Aside type='note' title='Only specify direct permissions for roles'>

When creating or updating a role programmatically, specify only the direct permissions. Scalekit automatically handles inherited permissions from base roles. Both direct and inherited permissions will appear in tokens and API responses.
