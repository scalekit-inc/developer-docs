Build applications that enable organization owners to invite users to join their organization. Scalekit takes care of sending the invite emails, verifying their email addresses, and creating the user accounts end to end.

Invite-only signup is ideal for the following scenarios:

- **Closed beta applications**: You want to control who can access your application during the beta phase.
- **Enterprise applications**: Organization admins need to invite team members to join their workspace.
- **B2B SaaS platforms**: You want to restrict access to invited users only
- **Exclusive communities**: Applications that require invitation-based membership.

Scalekit helps you implement invite-only signup flows while handling the complexity of user management and authentication.

## Set up invite-only signup page with Scalekit

You can implement invite-only signup by configuring Scalekit to disable public signups and using the invitation flow. This ensures that only invited users can create accounts.

<Steps>
 1. ### Configure your application for invite-only access

    <InstallSDKSection />

    Copy your API credentials from the Scalekit dashboard's API Config section and set them as environment variables.
    ```bash
    SCALEKIT_ENVIRONMENT_URL='<YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_URL>'
    SCALEKIT_CLIENT_ID='<ENVIRONMENT_CLIENT_ID>'
    SCALEKIT_CLIENT_SECRET='<ENVIRONMENT_CLIENT_SECRET>'
    ```

    Create a new Scalekit client instance after initializing the environment variables.
    <EnvSection />

    <Aside type="tip" title="Disable public signups">
      Navigate to your Scalekit dashboard > **User Management** > **Settings** and turn off the "Allow public signups" option. This ensures that only invited users can create accounts, making your B2B app invite-only with a sign-in page but no public signup option.
    </Aside>

  2. ### Redirect users to the sign-in page
       Generate the authorization URL by passing a [registered](/fsa/reference/redirects) _callback URL_ and _scopes_ to the Scalekit SDK. Note that we don't include the `prompt: 'create'` parameter since public signup is disabled.

       <Tabs syncKey="tech-stack">
         <TabItem value="node" label="Node.js">
           ```javascript title="Express.js" wrap "authorizationUrl" {"Redirect user to Scalekit's authentication page":7}
           const redirectUri = 'http://localhost:3000/api/callback';
           const options = {
             scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'email', 'offline_access'],
           };

           const authorizationUrl = scalekit.getAuthorizationUrl(redirectUri, options);

           res.redirect(authorizationUrl);
           ```
         </TabItem>
         <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
           ```python title="Flask"

           redirect_uri = 'http://localhost:3000/api/callback'
           options = AuthorizationUrlOptions(
               scopes=['openid', 'profile', 'email', 'offline_access']
           )

           authorization_url = scalekit.get_authorization_url(redirect_uri, options)

           # For web frameworks like Flask/Django:
           # return redirect(authorization_url)
           ```
         </TabItem>
         <TabItem value="go" label="Go">
           ```go title="Gin"
           redirectUri := "http://localhost:3000/api/callback"
           options := scalekit.AuthorizationUrlOptions{
               Scopes: []string{"openid", "profile", "email", "offline_access"},
           }

           authorizationUrl, err := scalekit.GetAuthorizationUrl(redirectUri, options)
           if err != nil {
               // handle error appropriately
               panic(err)
           }

           // For web frameworks like Gin:
           // c.Redirect(http.StatusFound, authorizationUrl.String())
           ```
         </TabItem>
         <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
           ```java title="Spring"
           import com.scalekit.internal.http.AuthorizationUrlOptions;
           import java.net.URL;
           import java.util.Arrays;

           String redirectUri = "http://localhost:3000/api/callback";
           AuthorizationUrlOptions options = new AuthorizationUrlOptions();
           options.setScopes(Arrays.asList("openid", "profile", "email", "offline_access"));

           URL authorizationUrl = scalekit.authentication().getAuthorizationUrl(redirectUri, options);
           ```
         </TabItem>
       </Tabs>
     This will redirect the user to Scalekit's managed sign-in page without signup options.

3. ### Retrieve user profile after authentication
      Scalekit triggers a callback to your registered _callback URL_ with an authorization code. Exchange the code to get the user's profile information.
      <RetrieveUserDetailsSection />

      The `authenticateWithCode` method returns an object containing the user's profile information (`user` object) and `idToken` (JWT).
      <UserProfileSection />

      You can [decode the `idToken`](https://authplay.io/pg/token-explorer) to access user information like email, name, and profile verification status directly from the token claims.
</Steps>

With these configurations, your B2B application now has a sign-in page but no public signup option, ensuring that only invited users can access your application. After successful authentication, you can proceed to [create a session](/fsa/guides/implement-signin/#create-a-user-session).

## Invite-only sign up using Scalekit SDK

For applications where you want to build custom invitation flows in your own UI, Scalekit provides APIs to programmatically invite users. This is ideal when organization admins or workspace owners need to invite team members directly from your application's dashboard.

Common use cases include:

- **Admin dashboards**: Organization admins can invite users from a settings or team management page.
- **Bulk invitations**: Import and invite multiple users at once from CSV files or directory systems.
- **Custom workflows**: Implement approval processes or conditional invitations based on business logic.
- **Integration with existing systems**: Connect invitation flows with your CRM, HR systems, or user directories.

<Steps>
 1. ### Create user invitations programmatically

    To invite a user to an organization, create a user membership with their email address and the target organization ID. Scalekit handles sending the invitation email and managing the signup process.

    <CreateUserMembershipSection />

    **Key parameters:**
    - `email`: The email address of the user to invite (required)
    - `organization_id`: The ID of the organization they're joining (required)
    - `sendActivationEmail`: Set to `true` to automatically send invitation emails (recommended)
    - `roles`: Optional array of roles to assign to the invited user
    - `metadata`: Optional custom data to associate with the membership

 2. ### Handle invitation responses

    When a user is successfully invited, Scalekit returns a user object with membership details. The membership status will be `INVITED` until the user accepts the invitation.

    ```json title="Example invitation response"
    {
      "user": {
        "id": "usr_01HTR0ABCXYZ",
        "environmentId": "env_01HTQZ99MMNZ",
        "createTime": "2025-06-19T15:41:22Z",
        "updateTime": "2025-06-19T15:41:22Z",
        "email": "user@example.com",
        "externalId": "crm-user-87425",
        "memberships": [
          {
            "organizationId": "org_xxxxxxxxxxxx",
            "joinTime": "2025-06-19T15:41:22Z",
            "membershipStatus": "ACTIVE",
            "roles": [
              {
                "id": "role_admin",
                "name": "admin"
              }
            ],
            "primaryIdentityProvider": "IDENTITY_PROVIDER_UNSPECIFIED",
            "metadata": {
              "plan": "free",
              "department": "Engineering"
            }
          }
        ],
        "userProfile": {
          "id": "prof_01HTR0PQRMNO",
          "firstName": "John",
          "lastName": "Doe",
          "name": "John Doe",
          "locale": "en",
          "emailVerified": false,
          "phoneNumber": "",
          "metadata": {},
          "customAttributes": {}
        },
        "metadata": {
          "plan": "free",
          "department": "Engineering"
        },
        "lastLogin": null
      }
    }
    ```

    <Aside type="note" title="Membership status tracking">
      Monitor the `membershipStatus` field to track invitation progress:
      - `PENDING_INVITE`: User has been invited but hasn't accepted yet
      - `ACTIVE`: User has accepted the invitation and can access the organization
      - `INVITE_EXPIRED`: Membership has been deactivated
    </Aside>

 3. ### User accepts invitation and signs up <Badge type="caution" text="WIP" />

    {
     /**
      * TODO: After users clicks on "Accept invitation" button, they are redirected to login initiate URL.
      - Should this endpoint be host a route in your application?
      - If yes, how to handle the callback? Do they get a token from Scalekit like in Magic Link?
      - Do they directly just forward the redirect to Authorization URL?
     */
    }
    When an invited user clicks the invitation link in their email, they're directed to your application's [registered initiate login endpoint](/fsa/reference/redirects/#redirect-types).
    1. The purpose of this endpoint is to initiate the login flow.
    2. Construct a authorization endpoint and redirect the user to it.
    3. Scalekit hosted login page appaers and tries to login.
    4. Depending on the default authentication methods your enabled on the Scalekit dashboard, the user tries to login with one of those methods.
    5. User will get a email from Scalekit to verify their email address and login into your application.
