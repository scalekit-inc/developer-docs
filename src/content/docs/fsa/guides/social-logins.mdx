Social logins allow users to sign in to your application using their existing accounts from providers like Google, Microsoft, and GitHub. Users can authenticate using any of the following methods:

- Direct provider authentication when specifying a provider
- Scalekit's hosted UI displaying all configured social providers
- Combination of multiple social providers based on your configuration

This guide shows you how to enable social login for your application.

This guide shows you how to enable each social login method. You should complete the [quickstart guide](/fsa/quickstart/) before following this guide, as it covers building a sign-in page that combines Scalekit's hosted UI.

## Configure social login settings

You can manage which social providers are available to your users and customize their behavior from the Scalekit dashboard without changing your code.

### Add social providers

<Steps>

1. Log in to your [Scalekit Dashboard](https://app.scalekit.com).
2. Navigate to **Authentication > Social Logins**.
3. Select a provider and enter the required credentials (typically a Client ID and Client Secret) from your provider's developer console.
4. Save the connection.

</Steps>

Learn how to configure individual [social connection providers](/guides/integrations/social-connections/).

Once configured, the provider will be available on your sign-in page for users to sign into your application.
