Once you've created organizations, configure their settings to enable enterprise features and manage authentication policies. This guide shows you how to access settings, configure domains, and help enterprise customers set up SSO through the dashboard.

## Access organization settings

Navigate to **Dashboard > Organizations** and select the organization you want to configure. Each organization has dedicated tabs for different configuration areas that control authentication routing and enterprise features.

<Steps>

1. ## Update organization details

   In the **Overview** tab, configure basic organization information:

   - **Display name** - Update the organization's name that appears to users
   - **Metadata** - Store custom properties like subscription plans or billing details
   - **Features** - Review enabled capabilities like Single Sign On and SCIM Provisioning

2. ## Generate admin portal links

   Use the **Admin Portal** section to create secure configuration links for enterprise customers:

   1. Click **Generate Portal Link**
   2. Set the expiration time (up to 24 hours)
   3. Copy the link and send it to your customer's IT administrator
   4. The customer can use this link to:
      - Connect their identity provider (Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace)
      - Configure SAML or OIDC authentication
      - Set up SCIM user provisioning
      - Test their SSO connection

   <Aside type="tip">
   Portal links expire automatically for security. Generate new links when customers need to make configuration changes.
   </Aside>

3. ## Configure authentication domains

   Set up domains in the **Domains** section to control authentication routing:

   1. **Organization domains** - Add email domains that should route to this organization's SSO
   2. **Verification** - Verify domain ownership through DNS records
   3. **Primary domain** - Set the main domain for this organization

   When users with these domains try to sign in, Scalekit automatically routes them to the organization's configured SSO provider.

</Steps>

## Manage security and access controls

Configure authentication policies and access controls to meet enterprise security requirements.

### Security policies

Navigate to the **Security** tab to configure **Domain access controls**, which restricts sign-ups to verified domains.

### Allowed email domains

Under **Security > Domains**, configure which email domains can join this organization:

1. Add trusted corporate domains (e.g., `@company.com`)
2. Block disposable email providers
3. Enable automatic organization suggestions for matching domains
4. Set up domain verification requirements

<Aside type="note">
Organization domains (for SSO routing) appear in the main **Domains** section, while allowed email domains (for access control) are configured under **Security > Domains**.
</Aside>

## Enable enterprise features

Configure SSO and user provisioning for enterprise customers who need centralized identity management.

### Single Sign On setup

Use the **Single Sign On** tab to connect identity providers:

1. **Choose connection type** - SAML 2.0 or OIDC/OAuth
2. **Configure provider settings** - Upload metadata or enter connection details
3. **Map user attributes** - Ensure email, name, and role information flows correctly
4. **Test the connection** - Verify authentication works before going live
5. **Enable just-in-time provisioning** - Automatically create user accounts during first login <Badge type="note" text="Coming soon" />

### SCIM provisioning configuration

Enable automated user management in the **SCIM Provisioning** tab:

1. **Generate SCIM endpoint** - Get the URL and bearer token for your identity provider
2. **Configure user synchronization** - Set up automatic user creation, updates, and deletion
3. **Enable group mapping** - Sync organizational units or teams from your directory
4. **Test provisioning** - Verify users can be created and managed automatically
