Passkeys replace passwords with biometric authentication (fingerprint, face recognition) or device PINs. Built on FIDO® standards (WebAuthn and CTAP), passkeys offer superior security by eliminating phishing and credential stuffing vulnerabilities, while also providing a seamless one-tap login experience. Unlike traditional authentication methods, passkeys sync across devices, removing the need for multiple enrollments and providing better recovery options when devices are lost.

Passkeys provide a log in experience for users. During sign-up, you'll continue to use established authentication methods like [verification codes, magic links](/fsa/guides/passwordless/) or [social logins](/social-logins/quickstart/). Once a user is registered, they can then add passkeys as an additional, convenient login option.

Your [existing Scalekit integration](/fsa/quickstart/) already supports passkeys. To implement, enable passkeys in the Scalekit dashboard and leverage Scalekit's built-in user passkey registration functionality.


## Enable users to register passkeys

<Steps>
1. Go to Scalekit Dashboard > Authentication > Auth methods > Passkeys and click "Enable"

2. To enable users to register and manage their passkeys, redirect them to the Scalekit passkey registration page.

    ```js title="Passkey Registration URL" showLineNumbers=false
    <SCALEKIT_ENVIRONMENT_URL>/ui/profile/passkeys
    ```
    The `SCALEKIT_ENVIRONMENT_URL` is your Scalekit tenant URL.

    This opens a page where users can:
    - Register new passkeys
    - Remove existing passkeys
    - View their registered passkeys

</Steps>

## Users can login with passkeys

Users who have registered passkeys can login with them.

This time when login page shows, users can select "Passkey" as the authentication method.

<Aside>

Scalekit authenticates users through the browser's native passkey API. This API prompts users to authenticate with device-supported passkeys — such as fingerprint, PIN, or password managers.
