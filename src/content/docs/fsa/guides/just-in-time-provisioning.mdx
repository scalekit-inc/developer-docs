Just-in-time (JIT) provisioning automatically creates users and their organization memberships when they sign in through Enterprise SSO for the first time. This eliminates the need for manual invitations and allows users to access your application immediately after authenticating with their identity provider.

## Introduction

JIT provisioning is designed for enterprise customers who want seamless, secure onboarding for their employees. As soon as an organization sets up an SSO connection, JIT provisioning is enabled by default.

When a user signs in through SSO for the first time and JIT provisioning is enabled for that connection, Scalekit automatically:

1. **Creates the user account** — Scalekit generates a new user profile using information from the identity provider.
2. **Establishes membership** — The user is added as a member of the organization.
3. **Completes authentication** — The user is signed in and redirected to your application.

This process occurs entirely in the background, enabling immediate access without manual steps from admins.

## Enabling JIT provisioning

JIT provisioning must be enabled on the organization’s SSO connection. You can enable it in the Scalekit Dashboard, programmatically via the API, or expose it to your customers through the Admin Portal.

### Enable via Dashboard

You can enable JIT provisioning in the Scalekit Dashboard:

<Steps>

1. Log in to your [Scalekit Dashboard](https://app.scalekit.com).
2. Navigate to **Organizations** and select the organization.
3. Go to **Single Sign On** → **Settings** → **Just-in-time provisioning**.
4. Toggle the setting to enable JIT provisioning.

</Steps>

### Enable via API

You can also enable JIT provisioning programmatically using the Scalekit API:

<InstallSDK />

```javascript title="Enable JIT provisioning"
// Coming soon — API to enable JIT provisioning
```

### Admin Portal

You can expose JIT provisioning settings to be configured by your end customers via Admin Portal.
<Steps>

1. Generate and share Admin Portal with your end customers to set up SSO for their organization. Learn more about generating [Admin Portal](/guides/sso/admin-portal/) for an organization.
2. Your end customer can manage the JIT configuration in **Single Sign On** > **Settings** > **Just-in-time provisioning** section.

</Steps>

## Domain restriction
JIT provisioning only works for users whose email domain matches one of the organization’s registered Organization Domains. This ensures that only verified members of the organization can be automatically provisioned.
Learn more about [Organization domains](/fsa/guides/enterprise-sso/#organization-domains).

## Guest users

JIT provisioning has limitations for guest users whose email domains do not match the organization domains registered for an organization.

- **Contractors and external users** with non-matching domains cannot be automatically provisioned.
- These users must be [manually invited](/fsa/guides/user-invitations/) to join the organization.
- This ensures that unauthorized users cannot obtain access automatically.

## What's next?

- Learn about [Allowed Email Domains](/fsa/guides/allowed-email-domains/) for non-SSO authentication methods.
- Explore [Enterprise SSO](/fsa/guides/enterprise-sso/) setup and configuration.
- Set up [organization switching](/fsa/guides/organization-switching/) for users who belong to multiple organizations.
