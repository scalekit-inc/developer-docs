Authentication is how a user proves their identity before your application grants access. In B2B scenarios the stakes are higher: one user can belong to multiple organizations, each with its own security policy. Scalekit lets you offer several authentication methods so every organization—and every user—can sign in the way that works best for them.

Choose from the following options:

<CardGrid>

  <LinkCard
    title="Passwordless"
    href="/fsa/guides/passwordless/"
    description="Users sign in using verification code (OTP) or a secure magic link sent to their email."
  />

  <LinkCard
    title="Social logins"
    href="/fsa/guides/social-logins/"
    description="Users sign in using their existing accounts from popular social media platforms like Google or GitHub."
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Enterprise SSO"
    href="/fsa/guides/enterprise-sso/"
    description="Users sign in with their organization's Single Sign-On (SSO) credentials."
  />

</CardGrid>

- **Multiple sign-in options**: Offer passwordless, social logins, or enterprise SSO so users can choose their preferred method.
- **Admin-enforced policies**: Organization administrators restrict members to specific methods (for example, SSO-only for employees). <Badge type="note" text="Coming soon" />
- **Bring-your-own login page**: Embed your own UI while Scalekit handles the secure identity verification flow behind the scenes.
- **Progressive rollout**: Enable additional methods without deploying new code—turn features on or off from the Scalekit dashboard.
