Sign-up restrictions control who can create accounts or be invited to existing organizations. This helps maintain data quality and prevent misuse by ensuring that only users with legitimate email addresses join your application. You can use sign-up restrictions to:

- Prevent registrations and invitations from generic email domains such as `@gmail.com` or `@outlook.com`.
- Block disposable email addresses from signing up or being invited to your application.

The following diagram illustrates how sign-up restrictions work:

```d2
direction: right;

user
Scalekit.sign-up page

user -> Scalekit.sign-up page: "ben0948@gmail.com"
user -> Scalekit.sign-up page: "woxoco4761@knilkk.com"
Scalekit.sign-up page -- restricted: "ðŸš«"
```

## How restrictions affect invitations

- Any user with a disposable email domain cannot sign up to create a new organization and cannot be invited to any existing organization.
- Any user with a public email domain cannot sign up to create a new organization and cannot be invited to any existing organization.

## Set sign-up restrictions

Go to **Authentication** > **General** in your Scalekit dashboard and toggle the following options based on what suits your application. Click **Save**
