Sign-up restrictions help you maintain data quality and prevent abuse by controlling who can create accounts in your application. This is particularly important for B2B applications where you need to ensure users have legitimate business email addresses rather than personal or temporary accounts.

These restrictions automatically block registrations and invitations from two types of email addresses:

- **Generic email domains** - Public email providers like `@gmail.com`, `@outlook.com`, or `@yahoo.com` that anyone can use
- **Disposable email addresses** - Temporary email services often used for spam, trial abuse, or avoiding accountability

When enabled, these restrictions apply to both direct signups and organization invitations, ensuring consistent policy enforcement across your application. This prevents users from creating multiple trial accounts, maintains clean analytics, and ensures your user base consists of verified business contacts.

The following diagram illustrates how sign-up restrictions work:

```d2
direction: right;

user
Scalekit.sign-up page
Scalekit.invite user

user -> Scalekit: "ben0948@gmail.com"
user -> Scalekit: "woxoco4761@knilkk.com"
Scalekit -- restricted: "🚫"
```

## How restrictions affect invitations

- Any user with a disposable email domain cannot sign up to create a new organization and cannot be invited to any existing organization.
- Any user with a public email domain cannot sign up to create a new organization and cannot be invited to any existing organization.

## Set sign-up restrictions

<Steps>
1. ### Navigate to sign-up restrictions settings

   Go to **Dashboard > Authentication > General** and locate the sign-up restrictions section.

2. ### Configure restriction options

   Toggle the following options based on what suits your application:

   - **Block disposable email domains**: Prevents temporary/disposable email addresses from signing up or being invited
   - **Block public email domains**: Prevents generic email providers like Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo from creating organizations

   <Aside type="tip" title="Choosing the right restrictions">
     Enable disposable email blocking for all production applications to prevent abuse. Only enable public email blocking if you're building a B2B application that requires verified business identities.
   </Aside>

3. ### Save your settings

   Click **Save** to apply the restrictions. Changes take effect immediately for all new signups and invitations.

   <Aside type="note">
     Existing users with restricted email domains remain unaffected. You can return to this section anytime to update your restrictions.
