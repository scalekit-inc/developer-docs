Sign-up restrictions allow you to control who can create accounts in your application. This feature helps maintain data quality and prevent misuse by ensuring that only users with legitimate email addresses can register. You can use sign-up restrictions to:

- Prevent registrations from generic email domains such as `@gmail.com` or `@outlook.com`.
- Block disposable email addresses from signing up to your application.

The following diagram illustrates how sign-up restrictions work:

```d2
direction: right;

user
Scalekit.sign-up page

user -> Scalekit.sign-up page: "ben0948@gmail.com"
user -> Scalekit.sign-up page: "woxoco4761@knilkk.com"
Scalekit.sign-up page -- restricted: "ðŸš«"
```

## Set sign-up restrictions

Go to **User Management** > **Settings** in your Scalekit dashboard and toggle the following options based on what suits your application. Click **Save**
