Passwordless authentication allows your users to sign in without entering a password. Users can authenticate using any of the following methods:

- A verification code (OTP) sent by email.
- A magic link sent by email.
- Both a verification code and a magic link sent by email.

This guide shows you how to enable each passwordless login method. You should complete the [quickstart guide](/fsa/quickstart/) before following this guide, as it covers building a sign-in page that combines Scalekit's hosted UI.

## Configure passwordless login settings

You can modify the passwordless login behavior from the Scalekit dashboard without changing your code.

### Choose a passwordless login method

<Steps>

1. Navigate to the Authentication tab in your Scalekit dashboard environment.
2. Select one of the following options:

    | Method | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | Verification code (OTP) | Users receive a one-time code via email that they must enter to sign in. |
    | Magic link | Users receive a secure link via email that they can click to sign in directly. |
    | Verification code and magic link | Users receive both a verification code and a magic link via email, allowing them to choose their preferred method. |

3. Click Save to apply your changes.

</Steps>

### Enable same browser origin enforcement

When you enable this setting, users must complete the magic link authentication in the same browser where they initiated the sign-in process.

**Enhanced Security**: This prevents potential phishing attacks and unauthorized access attempts where attackers might intercept magic links and use them from different devices or browsers.

To enable this feature, check the "Enforce same browser origin" option under the Passwordless section, then click Save to apply the changes.

### Customize email templates

You can customize the emails sent to users to match your brand, or you can [bring your own email provider](/guides/passwordless/custom-email-provider/) to handle email sends related to passwordless login. Scalekit sends the emails when you use it as your email provider.
