Magic link & OTP authentication allows your users to sign in without entering a password. Users can authenticate using any of the following methods:

- A verification code (OTP) sent by email.
- A magic link sent by email.
- Both a verification code and a magic link sent by email.

This guide shows you how to enable each magic link & OTP method. You should complete the [quickstart guide](/fsa/quickstart/) before following this guide, as it covers building a sign-in page that combines Scalekit's hosted UI.

## Configure magic link & OTP settings

You can modify the magic link & OTP behavior from the Scalekit dashboard without changing your code.

### Select magic link & OTP options

<Steps>

1. Navigate to the Authentication tab in your Scalekit dashboard environment.
2. Select one of the following options:

    | Method | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | Verification code (OTP) | Users receive a one-time code via email that they must enter to sign in. |
    | Magic link | Users receive a secure link via email that they can click to sign in directly. |
    | Verification code and magic link | Users receive both a verification code and a magic link via email, allowing them to choose their preferred method. |

3. Click Save to apply your changes.

</Steps>

### Enable same browser origin enforcement

This setting improves security by requiring users to complete magic link authentication in the same browser where they initiated the sign-in process. This helps prevent phishing attacks where an attacker could use an intercepted magic link on a different device or browser.

To enable this setting, select the **Enforce same browser origin** checkbox in the **Passwordless** section, and click **Save**.

### Enable new passwordless credentials on resend

This setting improves security by generating a new verification code or magic link each time a user asks to resend one. This invalidates the previously sent credential.

To enable this setting, select the **Enable new passwordless credentials on resend** checkbox in the **Passwordless** section, and click **Save**.

### Customize email templates

You can customize the emails sent to users to match your brand, or you can [bring your own email provider](/guides/passwordless/custom-email-provider/) to handle email sends related to magic link & OTP authentication. Scalekit sends the emails when you use it as your email provider.
