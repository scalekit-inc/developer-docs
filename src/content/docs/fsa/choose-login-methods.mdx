Configure authentication methods to match your users' preferences and your organization's requirements. Scalekit supports passwordless, social, and enterprise SSO authentication options that can be used individually or combined.

## Choose the right authentication methods

Different authentication methods serve different user types and security requirements:

| Method | Best for | User experience & Security |
|--------|----------|---------------------------|
| **Passwordless** | General users, quick onboarding | Frictionless, no passwords to remember. High security with email verification |
| **Social login** | Consumer apps, familiar providers | One-click sign-in with existing accounts. Medium security (depends on provider) |
| **Enterprise SSO** | B2B customers, organizations | Single sign-on with corporate identity. Highest security (organization-controlled) |

### When to use multiple methods

**Recommended combinations:**
- **Passwordless + Social** - Consumer apps with broad appeal
- **Passwordless + SSO** - B2B apps with both individual and enterprise users
- **All three methods** - Multi-tenant platforms serving diverse user bases

**Organization-specific routing:**
Enterprise users are automatically routed to their organization's configured SSO method, while individual users see passwordless and social options.

## Configure passwordless login

In the dashboard, go to **Authentication > Auth methods > Passwordless**


![](@/assets/docs/unlisted/passwordless/1-v2.png)

To protect your application, Scalekit limits a user to **five** attempts to enter the correct OTP within a ten-minute window for each authentication request. If the user exceeds this limit, they must restart the authentication process.

Users can sign in securely by:

 - Entering a verification code sent to their email
 - Clicking a magic link sent to their email


## Configure enterprise SSO

Enterprise SSO allows organizations to authenticate users through their corporate identity provider (Okta, Azure AD, etc.). Users are automatically routed to their organization's SSO based on their email domain or organization membership.

### Organization-aware authentication

Route enterprise users to their organization's SSO connection:

  organizationId: 'org_12345',        // Route to organization's SSO

```

```java title="Spring" {3-4} "setOrganizationId"
AuthorizationUrlOptions options = new AuthorizationUrlOptions();
options.setScopes(Arrays.asList("openid", "profile", "email", "offline_access"));
options.setOrganizationId("org_12345");        // Route to organization's SSO
options.setLoginHint("user@company.com");      // Domain-based routing

URL authorizationUrl = scalekit.authentication().getAuthorizationUrl(redirectUri, options);
return new RedirectView(authorizationUrl.toString());
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Enterprise users see their identity provider's login page. Users verify their identity through the authentication policies set by their organization's administrator. After successful verification, the user profile is [normalized](/sso/guides/user-profile-details/) and sent to your app.

The organization should be set up with a valid SSO connection. [See the full implementation guide for testing and onboarding enterprise customers](/sso/quickstart/).
