Providers in Agent Actions represent third-party applications that your users can connect to and interact with through Scalekit's unified API. Each provider offers a set of tools and capabilities that can be executed on behalf of connected users.

## What are providers?

Providers are pre-configured integrations with popular third-party applications that enable your users to:

- **Connect their accounts** using secure authentication methods
- **Execute tools and actions** through a unified API interface
- **Access data and functionality** from external applications
- **Maintain secure connections** with proper authorization scopes

## Supported providers

Agent Actions supports a wide range of popular business applications:

## Provider capabilities

Each provider offers different capabilities based on their API and authentication model:

### Authentication methods

- **OAuth 2.0**: Most common authentication method for modern APIs
- **API Keys**: Simple authentication using static keys
- **JWT Tokens**: Token-based authentication with expiration
- **Custom Auth**: Provider-specific authentication mechanisms

### Available tools

Providers expose various tools that can be executed through Agent Actions:

<Aside type="note">
Tool availability depends on the specific provider and the user's permissions within that application.
</Aside>

**Common tool categories:**

- **Data retrieval**: Fetch emails, calendar events, files, or records
- **Data creation**: Create new items, send messages, or schedule events
- **Data modification**: Update existing records or settings
- **File operations**: Upload, download, or manage files
- **Communication**: Send notifications, messages, or alerts

### Rate limits and quotas

Each provider has different rate limits and quotas:

- **API rate limits**: Requests per minute/hour limitations
- **Data quotas**: Storage or transfer limitations
- **Feature restrictions**: Premium features or enterprise-only capabilities
- **Usage monitoring**: Track consumption against provider limits

## Provider configuration

### Adding a provider

<Steps>
1. **Navigate to providers** in your Agent Actions dashboard
2. **Select provider** from the available options
3. **Configure settings** such as scopes and permissions
4. **Set up authentication** method (OAuth, API key, etc.)
5. **Test connection** to verify provider setup
</Steps>

### Provider settings

Each provider can be configured with:

**Authentication settings:**
- OAuth client credentials (if using custom OAuth apps)
- API endpoint URLs
- Supported scopes and permissions
- Token refresh settings

**Tool configuration:**
- Available tools and their parameters
- Default values for common operations
- Custom tool definitions (if supported)
- Error handling preferences

**Rate limiting:**
- Request throttling settings
- Backoff strategies for rate limit errors
- Priority queues for different tool types
- Usage monitoring and alerting

## Working with provider APIs

### API integration

Agent Actions abstracts provider-specific APIs into a unified interface:

```javascript
// Example: Execute a tool across different providers
const result = await agentConnect.executeTools({
  connectedAccountId: 'user_123',
  provider: 'gmail',
  tool: 'send_email',
  parameters: {
    to: 'recipient@example.com',
    subject: 'Hello from Agent Actions',
    body: 'This email was sent via Agent Actions'
  }
});
```

### Error handling

Different providers may return different error formats. Agent Actions normalizes these into consistent error responses:

```javascript
// Consistent error structure across all providers
{
  error: {
    code: 'RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED',
    message: 'Provider rate limit exceeded',
    provider: 'gmail',
    details: {
      retryAfter: 60,
      limitType: 'requests_per_minute'
    }
  }
}
```

## Provider-specific considerations

### Google Workspace

- **OAuth scopes**: Requires specific scopes for different Google services
- **Rate limits**: Generous limits but varies by service
- **Data access**: Supports both personal and organization data
- **Security**: Supports domain-wide delegation for enterprise

### Microsoft 365

- **Authentication**: Supports both personal and work accounts
- **Graph API**: Unified API for all Microsoft services
- **Permissions**: Granular permission model
- **Compliance**: Built-in compliance and audit features

### Slack

- **Workspace apps**: Requires installation in each workspace
- **Bot tokens**: Different capabilities for bot vs user tokens
- **Rate limits**: Tier-based limits depending on workspace size
- **Channels**: Requires specific permissions for private channels

### Jira

- **Project access**: Permissions are project-specific
- **Issue types**: Different issue types have different fields
- **Workflows**: Custom workflows affect available actions
- **Atlassian Connect**: Supports app installation model

## Best practices

### Provider selection

- **Assess requirements**: Choose providers based on your users' needs
- **Check limitations**: Understand rate limits and feature restrictions
- **Consider maintenance**: Some providers require more ongoing maintenance
- **Evaluate security**: Review provider security practices and compliance

### Authentication setup

- **Use OAuth when possible**: More secure than API keys
- **Implement proper scopes**: Request only necessary permissions
- **Handle token refresh**: Implement automatic token refresh logic
- **Monitor auth status**: Track connected account authentication health

### Tool execution

- **Batch operations**: Group similar operations when possible
- **Respect rate limits**: Implement proper throttling and backoff
- **Cache results**: Cache frequently accessed data
- **Error recovery**: Implement retry logic for transient failures

## Monitoring and analytics

### Provider health

Monitor provider performance and availability:

- **API uptime**: Track provider API availability
- **Response times**: Monitor latency for different operations
- **Error rates**: Track errors by provider and tool type
- **Rate limit usage**: Monitor quota consumption

### Usage analytics

Track how your users interact with different providers:

- **Popular providers**: Which providers are used most
- **Tool usage**: Which tools are executed most frequently
- **User adoption**: How many users connect to each provider
- **Error patterns**: Common failure modes by provider
