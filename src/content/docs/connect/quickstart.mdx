This quickstart guide will help you get up and running with Agent Connect in minutes. You'll learn how to create connections, authenticate users, and execute your first tools.

## What you'll build

In this quickstart, you'll build a simple integration that:

1. **Authenticates a user with GMail** to authenticate their Gmail account via OAuth 2.0
2. **Sends an email** using the connected account
3. **Fetches recent emails** from the user's inbox

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **Scalekit account** with Agent Connect enabled
- **API credentials** (Client ID and Client Secret)
- **Development environment** (Node.js, Python, or similar)

## Step 1: Set up your environment

First, install the Scalekit SDK for your preferred language:
<InstallSDK />

## Step 2: Create a connected account

Let's authorize a user to access their Gmail account by creating a connected account. This represents the user's connection to their Gmail account:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```javascript
// Create a connected account for user
const connectedAccount = await agentConnect.accounts.create({
  connection_id: 'gmail', // this is the unique connection name for this application.
  identifier: 'user_123', // Your user's unique identifier. this can be email address or user_id from your system.
});

console.log('Connected account created:', connectedAccount.id);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
# Create a connected account for user
connected_account = agent_connect.accounts.create(
    connection_id=connection.id,
    identifier='user_123',  # Your user's unique identifier. this can be email address or user_id from your system.
)

print(f'Connected account created: {connected_account.id}')
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

```bash
curl -X POST "${SCALEKIT_ENVIRONMENT_URL}/v1/connect/accounts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${SCALEKIT_CLIENT_SECRET}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "connection_id": "CONNECTION_ID_FROM_STEP_2",
    "identifier": "user_123"
  }'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Authenticate the user

Generate an OAuth URL for the user to complete authentication. Once the user completes the auth workflow, our system will handle the token exchange and store the tokens in the connected account. This step is not needed if the user has already authenticated with the gmail provider before.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```javascript
// Generate the magic link using which the end user can complete the authentication process for their gmail account
const authUrl = await agentConnect.accounts.getAuthUrl(connectedAccount.id);

console.log('Redirect user to:', authUrl);
// In a real app, redirect the user to this URL
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
# Generate the magic link using which the end user can complete the authentication process for their gmail account
auth_url = agent_connect.accounts.get_auth_url(
    connected_account.id
)

print(f'Redirect user to: {auth_url}')
# In a real app, redirect the user to this URL
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

```bash
curl -X GET "${SCALEKIT_ENVIRONMENT_URL}/v1/connect/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/auth-url" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${SCALEKIT_ACCESS_TOKEN}" 
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 4: Execute a tool - Send an email

Now that the user is authenticated, you can execute tools on their behalf. Let's send an email:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```javascript
// Send an email
const emailResult = await agentConnect.tools.execute({
  connected_account_id: connectedAccount.id,
  tool: 'send_email',
  parameters: {
    to: 'recipient@example.com',
    subject: 'Hello from Agent Connect!',
    body: 'This is my first email sent via Agent Connect.',
    html_body: '<p>This is my first email sent via <strong>Agent Connect</strong>.</p>'
  }
});

console.log('Email sent:', emailResult);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
# Send an email
email_result = agent_connect.tools.execute(
    connected_account_id=connected_account.id,
    tool='send_email',
    parameters={
        'to': 'recipient@example.com',
        'subject': 'Hello from Agent Connect!',
        'body': 'This is my first email sent via Agent Connect.',
        'html_body': '<p>This is my first email sent via <strong>Agent Connect</strong>.</p>'
    }
)

print(f'Email sent: {email_result}')
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

```bash
curl -X POST "${SCALEKIT_BASE_URL}/v1/connect/tools/execute" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${SCALEKIT_ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "connected_account_id": "CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID",
    "tool": "send_email",
    "parameters": {
      "to": "recipient@example.com",
      "subject": "Hello from Agent Connect!",
      "body": "This is my first email sent via Agent Connect.",
      "html_body": "<p>This is my first email sent via <strong>Agent Connect</strong>.</p>"
    }
  }'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 5: Execute another tool - Fetch emails

Let's also fetch some recent emails from the user's inbox:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```javascript
// Fetch recent emails
const emails = await agentConnect.tools.execute({
  connected_account_id: connectedAccount.id,
  tool: 'fetch_emails',
  parameters: {
    query: 'is:unread',
    max_results: 10
  }
});

console.log('Recent emails:', emails.result);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
# Fetch recent emails
emails = agent_connect.tools.execute(
    connected_account_id=connected_account.id,
    tool='fetch_emails',
    parameters={
        'query': 'is:unread',
        'max_results': 10
    }
)

print(f'Recent emails: {emails.result}')
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

```bash
curl -X POST "${SCALEKIT_BASE_URL}/v1/connect/tools/execute" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${SCALEKIT_ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "connected_account_id": "CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID",
    "tool": "fetch_emails",
    "parameters": {
      "query": "is:unread",
      "max_results": 10
    }
  }'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
