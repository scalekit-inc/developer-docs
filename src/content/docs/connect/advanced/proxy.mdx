# Proxy

Agent Connect provides a proxy API that allows you to proxy API calls to third-party services. This is useful when you need to access a specific API endpoint that is not supported by Agent Connect.

## Usage

```javascript
const result = await agentConnect.proxy.call({
  url: 'https://api.example.com/data',
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer <your-token>'
```
