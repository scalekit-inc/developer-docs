Scalekit supports multiple environments to help you manage your application development lifecycle. Keep your development, staging, and production configurations separate while maintaining consistent authentication behavior.

## Environment types

Scalekit provides three default environments:

| Environment | Purpose |
| ----------- | ------- |
| **Development** | Local development and testing with relaxed security policies |
| **Staging** | Pre-production testing that mirrors production configuration |
| **Production** | Live environment with strict security policies and monitoring |

<Aside type="tip" title="Use separate environments">
  Keep your development and production environments separate to prevent accidental
  configuration changes from affecting your live users.
</Aside>

## Access environment settings

Navigate to **Dashboard > Settings > Environments** to view and manage your environments.

Each environment has its own:
- Environment ID and URL
- API credentials (client ID and secret)
- Redirect URLs
- Webhook endpoints
- Authentication method configurations

## Switch between environments

Use the environment selector in the top-right corner of the dashboard to switch between environments.

<Aside type="caution" title="Verify your environment">
  Always confirm you're working in the correct environment before making configuration changes.
  The dashboard displays the current environment name in the header.
</Aside>

## Configure environment-specific settings

### Redirect URLs

Each environment requires its own set of redirect URLs. Configure the appropriate URLs for your application in each environment:

- **Development**: `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
- **Staging**: `https://staging.yourapp.com/auth/callback`
- **Production**: `https://yourapp.com/auth/callback`

### API credentials

Each environment uses unique API credentials. Store credentials securely using environment variables:

```bash
# Development
SCALEKIT_ENVIRONMENT_ID=dev_env_123
SCALEKIT_CLIENT_ID=dev_client_abc
SCALEKIT_CLIENT_SECRET=dev_secret_xyz

# Production
SCALEKIT_ENVIRONMENT_ID=prod_env_456
SCALEKIT_CLIENT_ID=prod_client_def
SCALEKIT_CLIENT_SECRET=prod_secret_uvw
```

### Webhook endpoints

Configure different webhook endpoints for each environment to test webhook delivery in staging before enabling in production.

## Environment best practices

- **Never use production credentials in development**
- **Test all changes in staging before deploying to production**
- **Use environment-specific API endpoints**
- **Monitor logs separately for each environment**
- **Keep webhook configurations synchronized across environments**
