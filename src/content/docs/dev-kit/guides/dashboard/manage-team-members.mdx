Scalekit allows you to collaborate with your team by inviting members to your organization. Control who can access your dashboard and what actions they can perform based on their role.

## Access team management

Navigate to **Dashboard > Settings > Team** to view and manage team members.

## Team member roles

Scalekit supports two roles with different permission levels:

| Role | Permissions |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **Owner** | Full access to all settings, billing, and team management. Can invite and remove members. |
| **Member** | View and manage authentication configurations, but cannot access billing or remove other members. |

<Aside type="caution" title="At least one owner required">
  Your organization must have at least one owner at all times. The last owner cannot
  leave or change their role.
</Aside>

## Invite team members

1. Navigate to **Dashboard > Settings > Team**
2. Click **Invite member**
3. Enter the team member's email address
4. Select their role (Owner or Member)
5. Click **Send invite**

The invited member receives an email with a link to join your organization. They must sign in with their existing Scalekit account or create a new account to accept the invitation.

## Manage pending invitations

View and manage pending invitations from the Team settings page:

- **Resend invite** - Send a reminder email for pending invitations
- **Cancel invite** - Revoke a pending invitation before it's accepted

## Change member roles

1. Navigate to **Dashboard > Settings > Team**
2. Find the team member whose role you want to change
3. Click the **Role** dropdown next to their name
4. Select the new role

<Aside type="tip" title="Promote carefully">
  Only grant Owner role to trusted team members who need full access to billing
  and team management.
</Aside>

## Remove team members

1. Navigate to **Dashboard > Settings > Team**
2. Find the team member you want to remove
3. Click the **Remove** button next to their name
4. Confirm the removal

Removed team members immediately lose access to your organization's dashboard and configurations.

## Team member activity

View recent activity for each team member, including:
- When they joined the organization
- Recent configuration changes they made
- Last sign-in time

## Security best practices

- **Use the principle of least privilege** - Grant Member role by default
- **Regularly review team access** - Remove members who no longer need access
- **Monitor audit logs** - Track team member activity in the auth logs
- **Enable SSO for team access** - Require SSO authentication for dashboard access
