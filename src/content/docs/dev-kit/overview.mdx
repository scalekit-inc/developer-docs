Scalekit provides comprehensive developer resources to help you build authentication and identity management into your applications. Whether you're coding directly with our SDKs or using AI-powered development tools, we've built tools to accelerate your integration.

This overview introduces the key developer resources available in your Scalekit workspace and helps you choose the right path to get started.

## Developer Tools

Scalekit offers two primary development approaches to integrate authentication into your application:

<CardGrid>
  <FoldCard title="Scalekit SDKs" iconKey="code">
    Official SDKs for Node.js, Python, Go, and Java with production-ready auth helpers, automatic retries, and typed models. Install the SDK, initialize with your credentials, and start building.

    <p class="sdk-links"><a href="/authenticate/installation/">Get started with SDKs</a></p>
  </FoldCard>

  <FoldCard title="Scalekit MCP Server" iconKey="ai">
    Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects your AI coding assistants to Scalekit. Manage environments, organizations, users, and authentication through natural language queries in Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, and other MCP-compatible tools.

  </FoldCard>
</CardGrid>

## Quick Start Paths

Choose your development approach based on how you prefer to work:

### Traditional SDK Integration

Install and configure the Scalekit SDK in your application code. This path is ideal when:

- You want direct control over authentication implementation
- You're building server-side applications in Node.js, Python, Go, or Java
- You need production-ready auth helpers and typed models
- You prefer traditional IDE-based development

**Start here:** [Set up Scalekit SDK](/authenticate/installation/)

### AI-Assisted Development <Badge text="New" variant="tip" />

Connect your AI coding assistant to Scalekit through the MCP server. This path is ideal when:

- You use AI tools like Claude Desktop, Cursor, or Windsurf for development
- You want to interact with Scalekit using natural language
- You need to quickly manage environments, organizations, and users
- You're building or testing MCP-compatible AI applications

**Start here:** [Set up Scalekit MCP Server](/dev-kit/mcp/)

## SDK Support

Scalekit maintains official SDKs across four languages with consistent APIs and feature parity:

    description="Server and edge compatible (Node 18+). Typed models and auth helpers."
    href="https://github.com/scalekit-inc/scalekit-sdk-node"
    target="_blank"

  <LinkCard
    title="Python SDK"
    description="Pythonic client with simple auth utilities and retries."
    href="https://github.com/scalekit-inc/scalekit-sdk-python"
    target="_blank"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Go SDK"
    description="Lightweight, idiomatic Go client for services and CLIs."
    href="https://github.com/scalekit-inc/scalekit-sdk-go"
    target="_blank"

    href="https://github.com/scalekit-inc/scalekit-sdk-java"
    target="_blank"
  />
</CardGrid>

<Aside type="tip" title="All SDKs include">
- Automatic retries and error handling
- Production-ready authentication helpers
- Typed models for IDE autocomplete
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Regular updates and security patches
</Aside>

## MCP Server Features

The Scalekit MCP server provides AI assistants with tools to manage your Scalekit workspace:

- **Environment management** - Configure and switch between development and production environments
- **Organization management** - Create, update, and manage organizations
- **User management** - Add, update, and remove users from organizations
- **Connection setup** - Configure OIDC and SAML authentication connections
- **Role administration** - Manage roles, permissions, and access control
- **Admin portal** - Generate admin portal links for enterprise customers

The MCP server uses OAuth 2.1 authentication to securely connect your AI tools to your Scalekit workspace.

<Aside type="note">
Compatible with Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code (1.101+), and any MCP-compatible client.
</Aside>

## Development Environments

Scalekit provides dedicated development and production environments to safely build and test authentication:

- **Development environment** - `https://{your-subdomain}.scalekit.dev`
- **Production environment** - `https://{your-subdomain}.scalekit.com`

Both SDKs and the MCP server support environment switching through configuration. Use the development environment for testing and the production environment for live applications.

View your environment URLs in **Dashboard > Developers > Settings**.

## API Authentication

All Scalekit developer tools use the OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow for secure API authentication:

1. Navigate to **Dashboard > Developers > Settings > API credentials**
2. Copy your environment URL, client ID, and client secret
3. Configure your SDK or MCP server with these credentials

<Aside type="caution">
Never commit API credentials to version control. Use environment variables or secure secret management.
