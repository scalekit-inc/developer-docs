Use `npx @scalekit-sdk/dryrun` when you want to confirm your Scalekit authentication configuration works end-to-end before implementing auth integration into your app.

Dryrun command executes a complete authentication flow locally - spinning up a server, opening your browser, and displaying the authenticated user's profile and tokens, so you can catch configuration errors early.

Works with Full Stack Authentication and Modular SSO.

## Prerequisites

Before running Dryrun, ensure you have:

- **Node.js 20 or higher** installed locally.
- **A Scalekit environment** with an OAuth client configured.
- **A redirect URI** (`http://localhost:12456/auth/callback`) added in the Scalekit Dashboard under **Authentication > Redirect URIs**.

## Run Dryrun

From any directory:

```bash wrap title="Terminal" showLineNumbers=false
# Refer to prerequisites before running the command
npx @scalekit-sdk/dryrun \
  --env_url=<url> \
  --client_id=<id> \
  [--mode=<sso|fsa>] \
  [--organization_id=<id>]
```

| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--env_url`         | Scalekit environment URL, for example `https://env-abc123.scalekit.cloud`. <Badge text="Required" /> |
| `--client_id`       | OAuth client ID from the Scalekit Dashboard (starts with `skc_`). <Badge text="Required" /> |
| `--mode`            | `fsa` for full-stack auth, `sso` for SSO. Defaults to `fsa`. <Badge text="Optional" /> |
| `--organization_id` | Organization ID to authenticate against when `--mode=sso`. <Badge text="Required (SSO only)" /> |
| `--help`            | Show CLI usage help. <Badge text="Optional" /> |

## Review the authentication results

After successful authentication, the browser shows a local dashboard with:

- **User profile**: Name, email, avatar (when available).
- **ID token claims**: All claims returned in the ID token.
- **Token details**: A view of the raw token response.

Use this view to confirm:

- The correct user is returned for your test login.
- Claims such as `email`, `sub`, and any custom claims are present as expected.
- The flow works for both `fsa` and `sso` modes when configured.


## Common error scenarios

<details>
<summary>How do I fix redirect_uri mismatch errors?</summary>

If you see a `redirect_uri mismatch` error:

- Verify that `http://localhost:12456/auth/callback` is added in the Scalekit Dashboard under **Authentication > Redirect URIs**.
- Confirm that you spelled the URI exactly, including the port and path.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I fix invalid client_id errors?</summary>

If the CLI reports an invalid client ID:

- Copy the client ID directly from the dashboard to avoid typos.
- Make sure you are using a client from the same environment as `--env_url`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I resolve port conflicts?</summary>

If port `12456` is already in use:

- Stop any process that is already listening on port `12456`.
- Close other local tools or frameworks that use `http://localhost:12456` and try again.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I fix organization issues in SSO mode?</summary>

If you see errors related to `--organization_id`:

- Confirm that the organization exists in your Scalekit environment.
- Verify that SSO is configured for that organization in the dashboard.
- Ensure you are using the correct `org_...` identifier.

</details>



<Aside type="caution" title="Local testing only">
Dryrun is designed for **local testing only**:

- It runs entirely on `localhost` and does not expose any public endpoints.
- It does not persist tokens or credentials after the process exits.
- The CLI stops when you press `Ctrl+C`, which shuts down the local server.

Use this tool only in trusted local environments and never expose the local callback URL to the internet.
