Scalekit helps you quickly add enterprise authentication to your B2B SaaS app without engineering overhead. It provides plug-and-play auth solutions like SSO, SCIM, and Social Logins.

Built for B2B use cases, Scalekit natively supports multi-tenancy and organization management. You can test auth flows in sandbox environments, simulate SSO without real IdP accounts, and deploy instantly with prebuilt integrations for Okta, Entra ID, JumpCloud, Google SSO, and Azure AD—no custom code required.
