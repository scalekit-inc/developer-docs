Tool execution is the core functionality of Agent Actions that allows you to perform actions on third-party applications using connected accounts. Tools abstract complex API operations into simple, consistent function calls.

## What is tool execution?

Tool execution in Agent Actions enables you to:

- **Perform actions** on third-party applications via connected accounts
- **Execute operations** like sending emails, creating calendar events, or fetching data on-behalf-of users
- **Handle authentication** automatically using connected account tokens

## Tool execution workflow

1. **Identify the tool** you want to execute (e.g., `send_email`, `create_event`)
2. **Select connected account** that has the required permissions
3. **Prepare parameters** needed for the tool execution
4. **Execute the tool** using the Agent Actions API
5. **Handle the response** and any errors that occur

## Direct tool execution

Using Scalekit SDK, you can execute any action on behalf of a user using the following parameters:

- user context
- tool_name
- tool_input_parameters

```python
# Fetch recent emails
tool_response = actions.execute_tool(
    # connected_account gives the user context
    connected_account_id=connected_account.id,
    # tool name to execute
    tool='gmail_fetch_mails',
    # tool input parameters
    parameters={
        'query': 'is:unread',
        'max_results': 5
    }
)

print(f'Recent emails: {tool_response.result}')
```

### Tool Schema Inspection

To execute the tool calls effectively, you first need to understand the required parameters for any given tool. You can inspect the tool schema by fetching the tool metadata information using the scalekit sdk.

```python
tool_schema = agent_connect.tools.get_schema(tool='gmail_fetch_emails')
# tool_schema has description, input schema and output schema 
```
