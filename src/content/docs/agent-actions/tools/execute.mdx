Tool execution is the core functionality of Agent Actions that allows you to perform actions on third-party applications using connected accounts. Tools abstract complex API operations into simple, consistent function calls.

## What is tool execution?

Tool execution in Agent Actions enables you to:

- **Perform actions** on third-party applications via connected accounts
- **Execute operations** like sending emails, creating calendar events, or fetching data on-behalf-of users
- **Handle authentication** automatically using connected account tokens

## Tool execution workflow

1. **Identify the tool** you want to execute (e.g., `send_email`, `create_event`)
2. **Select connected account** that has the required permissions
3. **Prepare parameters** needed for the tool execution
4. **Execute the tool** using the Agent Actions API
5. **Handle the response** and any errors that occur

## Direct tool execution

Using Scalekit SDK, you can execute any action on behalf of a user using the following parameters:

- user context
- tool_name
- tool_input_parameters

```python
# Fetch recent emails
tool_response = actions.execute_tool(
    # connected_account gives the user context
    connected_account_id=connected_account.id,
    # tool name to execute
    tool='gmail_fetch_mails',
    # tool input parameters
    parameters={
        'query': 'is:unread',
        'max_results': 5
    }
)

print(f'Recent emails: {tool_response.result}')
```
