## What is Passwordless Authentication?

Passwordless authentication is a verification method that allows users to log in without entering a traditional password. Instead, users authenticate using alternative factors like email links, SMS codes, biometrics, or hardware tokens.

## Why Go Passwordless?

### Security Benefits

- **Eliminates password vulnerabilities**: No passwords to steal, phish, or crack
- **Reduces breach risk**: No password databases to compromise
- **Prevents credential stuffing**: Users can't reuse passwords
- **Minimizes social engineering**: Harder to trick users into revealing credentials

### User Experience Benefits

- **Faster login**: No need to remember or type passwords
- **Reduced friction**: Fewer password reset requests
- **Better accessibility**: Easier for users with disabilities
- **Cross-device convenience**: Login from any device with access to email/phone

## Common Passwordless Methods

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Magic Links" icon="approve-check">
    **How it works**: User receives a unique, time-limited link via email. Clicking the link authenticates them.

    **Best for**: Web applications, B2C products, quick logins

    **Example**: Slack, Medium, Notion
  </Card>

  <Card title="One-Time Passwords (OTP)" icon="pencil">
    **How it works**: User receives a temporary code via email or SMS that they enter to authenticate.

    **Best for**: Mobile apps, high-security scenarios, two-factor authentication

    **Example**: Banking apps, cryptocurrency exchanges
  </Card>

  <Card title="Biometric Authentication" icon="star">
    **How it works**: Uses fingerprint, face recognition, or other biometric data to verify identity.

    **Best for**: Mobile applications, native apps, consumer products

    **Example**: Apple Face ID, Windows Hello, Touch ID
  </Card>

  <Card title="Hardware Tokens" icon="setting">
    **How it works**: Physical security keys (like YubiKey) that verify user identity.

    **Best for**: Enterprise applications, high-security environments

    **Example**: Google Advanced Protection, enterprise VPNs
  </Card>

  <Card title="Push Notifications" icon="information">
    **How it works**: User approves login via a push notification on their registered mobile device.

    **Best for**: Multi-device setups, enterprise applications

    **Example**: Duo Security, Microsoft Authenticator
  </Card>

  <Card title="Passkeys (FIDO2/WebAuthn)" icon="rocket">
    **How it works**: Uses public-key cryptography and device biometrics for authentication.

    **Best for**: Modern web and mobile apps, replacing passwords entirely

    **Example**: Apple Passkeys, Google Passkeys
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Choosing the Right Method

Consider these factors when selecting a passwordless method:

1. **User Base**: Consumer vs. enterprise users have different expectations
2. **Device Support**: Mobile, web, or desktop application requirements
3. **Security Requirements**: Compliance and regulatory needs
4. **User Experience**: Balance between security and convenience
5. **Infrastructure**: Email/SMS delivery capabilities, biometric hardware availability
