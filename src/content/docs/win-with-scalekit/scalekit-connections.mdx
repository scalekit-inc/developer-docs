## Overview

A **Connection** in Scalekit represents a configured authentication method or identity provider that your users can use to sign in to your application. Connections are the building blocks of your authentication system.

## Types of Connections

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Social Connections" icon="open-book">
    OAuth-based authentication with social identity providers like Google, Microsoft, GitHub, LinkedIn, and more.

    **Use cases:**
    - Consumer applications
    - Quick sign-up flows
    - Social media integrations

    [View social connections →](/guides/integrations/social-connections/)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Enterprise SSO Connections" icon="seti:lock">
    SAML or OIDC-based connections to enterprise identity providers like Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, etc.

    **Use cases:**
    - B2B SaaS applications
    - Enterprise customer requirements
    - Compliance needs

  </Card>

  <Card title="Passwordless Connections" icon="approve-check">
    Magic link and OTP-based authentication without traditional passwords.

    **Use cases:**
    - Modern consumer apps
    - Frictionless authentication
    - Mobile applications

  </Card>

  <Card title="Database Connections" icon="seti:db">
    Traditional username/password authentication stored in Scalekit's secure user database.

    **Use cases:**
    - Custom authentication flows
    - Legacy application support
    - Full control over user data

## How Connections Work

### 1. Connection Configuration

When you set up a connection, you configure:

- **Authentication method**: SAML, OIDC, OAuth, passwordless, etc.
- **Identity provider details**: Endpoints, certificates, client credentials
- **User attribute mapping**: How IdP attributes map to your application's user model
- **Connection settings**: Domains, permissions, customizations

### 2. Connection Assignment

Connections can be assigned to:

- **Organizations**: Enterprise customers get their own SSO connection
- **Domains**: Auto-assign connections based on email domain
- **Applications**: Different apps can use different connections

### 3. Authentication Flow

When a user authenticates:

1. User initiates login
2. Scalekit determines the appropriate connection (based on email domain, organization, or user selection)
3. User is redirected to the identity provider
4. After successful authentication, user is redirected back to your app
5. Your app receives user information and creates a session

## Managing Connections

### Admin Portal

Enterprise customers can manage their own connections through the [Admin Portal](/guides/sso/admin-portal):

- Configure SSO settings
- Upload SAML metadata
- Test SSO integration
- Manage user provisioning

### Dashboard

You can manage all connections from the Scalekit Dashboard:

- Create and configure connections
- Monitor connection health
- View authentication logs
- Manage user attributes

### API

Programmatically manage connections using the Scalekit API:

- Create connections via API
- Update connection settings
- Enable/disable connections
- Query connection status

## Connection Best Practices

1. **Organization-based routing**: Route enterprise users to their SSO connection automatically
2. **Fallback options**: Provide alternative login methods if SSO fails
3. **Testing**: Use test mode to validate connections before production
4. **Monitoring**: Track connection health and authentication metrics
5. **User communication**: Inform users about their available login options

## Connection Examples

### Social Login Connection

```javascript
// User logs in with Google
const authUrl = scalekit.getAuthorizationUrl({
  connection: 'google-oauth',
  redirectUri: 'https://yourapp.com/callback'
})
```

### Enterprise SSO Connection

```javascript
// Enterprise user logs in with company SSO
const authUrl = scalekit.getAuthorizationUrl({
  organizationId: 'org_123',
  redirectUri: 'https://yourapp.com/callback'
})
// Automatically uses the organization's configured SSO connection
```

### Passwordless Connection

```javascript
// User logs in with magic link
await scalekit.passwordless.sendMagicLink({
  email: 'user@example.com',
  connection: 'email-magic-link',
  redirectUri: 'https://yourapp.com/callback'
})
```
