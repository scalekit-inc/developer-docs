# Requirements: Content Quality Improvement Initiative

**Defined:** 2025-02-16
**Core Value:** Documentation consistency equals developer trust. When pages follow same structure, voice, and quality standards, developers can focus on learning Scalekit instead of deciphering inconsistent patterns.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Opening Context

- [ ] **OPEN-01**: Add clear opening paragraphs (1-3) explaining what users will accomplish
- [ ] **OPEN-02**: Include context about when/why users need this feature
- [ ] **OPEN-03**: Preview key concepts or workflow for the page

### Content Quality

- [ ] **QUAL-01**: Use active voice and direct language (imperative for instructions)
- [ ] **QUAL-02**: Create smooth transitions between sections with transition phrases

### Structure & Navigation

- [ ] **STRUC-01**: Add proper frontmatter (title ≤60 chars, description ≤160 chars, sidebar label)
- [ ] **STRUC-02**: Ensure consistent heading hierarchy (H2, H3, H4 only)
- [ ] **STRUC-03**: Add `prev`/`next` navigation for sequential learning paths
- [ ] **STRUC-04**: Use meaningful link text (not "click here" or "this")

### Formatting & Standards

- [ ] **FMT-01**: Follow writing-standards/ guidelines (voice, tense, formatting)
- [ ] **FMT-02**: Use Dashboard path references (format: **Dashboard > Section > Subsection**)
- [ ] **FMT-03**: Apply inline code formatting for technical terms

### Security Documentation (hosted-widgets.mdx)

- [ ] **SEC-01**: Explain access control implications for Hosted Widgets
- [ ] **SEC-02**: Document security considerations for permission-based widget visibility
- [ ] **SEC-03**: Include security context in callouts where relevant

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Code Examples

- **CODE-01**: Add multi-language code examples (Node.js, Python, Go, Java) where applicable
- **CODE-02**: Include error handling in code examples
- **CODE-03**: Add code comments explaining real-world use cases

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature                                                           | Reason                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Adding new features or capabilities not already described         | Focus on improving existing content quality, not expanding feature scope |
| Changing underlying functionality described in these pages        | Preserve existing accuracy, improve presentation only                    |
| Updating other documentation pages outside of specified two files | Keep scope manageable and focused                                        |
| Complete content rewrite that loses existing information          | Improve quality without losing valuable existing content                 |
