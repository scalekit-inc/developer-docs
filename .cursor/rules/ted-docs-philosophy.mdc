# Documentation Writing Philosophy: Follow ted-docs-philosophy

All documentation sentences and phrasing must follow the principles outlined in [ted-docs-philosophy](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/articles/what_makes_documentation_good.md). This ensures clarity, consistency, and helpfulness for all readers.

**Key principles:**
- Write simply and clearly. Use short, unambiguous sentences.
- Avoid jargon and abbreviations unless necessary. Prefer specific, accurate terminology.
- Make docs easy to skim: use clear section titles, short paragraphs, topic sentences, and bulleted lists.
- Be consistent in style, formatting, and terminology.
- Do not presume the reader's state of mind. Avoid phrases like "Now you'll want to..."
- Prefer imperative mood and right-branching sentences.
- Bold important information and use tables or lists for clarity.
- Introduce topics with a broad opening and prioritize by value.
- Break these rules only when you have a good reason, always prioritizing the reader's needs.

**Examples:**
- Correct: "To call a function, use the following syntax."
- Incorrect: "Now you probably want to learn how to call a function."

This rule applies to all documentation files, such as [quickstart.mdx](mdc:src/content/docs/home/quickstart.mdx).
