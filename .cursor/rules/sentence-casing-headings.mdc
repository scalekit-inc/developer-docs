# Sentence Casing for Headings

All headings in documentation files must use sentence casing. This means only the first word and any proper nouns are capitalized, while the rest of the heading is in lowercase.

**Examples:**
- Correct: `Authenticate users`
- Incorrect: `Authenticate Users`, `AUTHENTICATE USERS`

This rule applies to all documentation files, such as [authenticate-users.mdx](mdc:src/content/docs/manual/getting-started/authenticate-users.mdx) and [quickstart.mdx](mdc:src/content/docs/home/quickstart.mdx).

**Why:**
- Improves readability and consistency across documentation.
- Aligns with modern documentation standards.

**How to fix:**
- When writing or editing a heading, ensure only the first word and proper nouns are capitalized.

**Scope:**
- All Markdown and MDX documentation files in the project.
